EpiDoc Guidelines
README.txt

2010-05-14

We are currently reorganizing the EpiDoc guidelines portion of the SF
repository. These are first steps toward bringing the guidelines up to 
match the latest P5 schema etc. We have tagged the current state of 
things (before we start changes) as tags/pre-r8-guidelines-upgrade.

See http://epidoc.sf.net for more information about EpiDoc.
