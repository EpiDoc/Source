What it is:
      The EpiDoc Guidelines is a prose document intended to provide
	complete guidance for the application of TEI markup to the preparation
	of digital editions of primary source documents like inscriptions or
	papyri.
	The canonical version of the Guidelines are also available in HTML at 
	http://www.stoa.org/epidoc/gl/

License:
      The EpiDoc Guidelines is copyright the contributors. 
	See LICENSE.txt for license details.

Technical requirements and limitations:
	The Guidelines consist of XML files in TEI P5, and as such
	they need to be transformed using a combination of the TEI XSLT 
	provided here and the example XSLT, for which see example-p5-xslt. 
	The Guidelines are part of the TEI ODD.
          
How to use it:
	(Explain how to generate HTML Guidelines from XML files - to be added)
