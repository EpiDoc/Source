   <p>Presenting the epigraphic text itself (tei:div type="edition")</p>
   <div>
      <head>General</head>
      <p>This section describes the division in which the edition of the epigraphic text itself is
         encoded. The edition of an inscription consists of the transcribed inscription with
         editorial interventions such as spacing, mixed case, accentuation, and the like, that regularize the text so that it can be read more easily. </p>
      <p>The detailed guidelines concerning the markup of traditionally transcribed issues are found
         under the heading of <xref id="taggingtext.xml">Tagging the Inscribed Text</xref>. The essential rule behind the EpiDoc ethos is that at a minimum every distinction that is traditionally made in Leiden-style transcription can also be made unambiguously in XML.</p>
   </div>
   <div>
      <head>Particulars</head>
      <p>An edition is tagged using the <tag>div @type='edition'</tag> element. There can be
         multiple editions of the same text; each edition should be enclosed in its own separate
            <tag>div @type='edition'</tag>.</p>
      <p>Authority for each edition is recorded in the corresponding <xref href="div-history.xml">source
            section of history</xref>, and in the corresponding external <xref href="div-apparatus.xml">apparatus criticus</xref>. The edition is linked to its
         corresponding sections <note>(how?)</note>; if there is but a single edition, the link may be considered
         to be implicit.</p>
      <p>The edition division can also be used to record a consolidated edition (similar to an
         eclectic manuscript editionâ€”e.g. brick-stamps, coins, Diocletian's Prices Edict, <title>Res
            Gestae</title>, Athenian Standards Decree, etc.). This is likely to require more
         involved apparatus and references. The individual inscriptions that form the basis of this
         edition should be documented in the 'source' division.</p>
