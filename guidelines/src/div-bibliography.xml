<!-- This is the bibliography section from P5, with Elli's modifications. 
    Since we don't support biblStruct in Epidoc, I have tried to eradicate
    references to is, as well as to biblFull. However, I didn't remove it 
    from all the examples yet, since this section isn't totally fixed in P5
    yet, and we will have to merge changes at some point.  Most of my changes
    consist of commenting sections out. Some prose has been added.

       ************ Commented out of Epidoc version *******************
       <p>Bibliographic references (that is, full descriptions of bibliographic
            items such as books, articles, films, broadcasts, songs, etc.) or
            pointers to them may appear at various places in a TEI text. They
            are required at several points within the TEI Header's source
            description, as discussed in section <ptr target="#HD3"/>; they may
            also appear within the body of a text, either singly (for example
            within a footnote), or collected together in a list as a distinct
            part of a text. </p>  
            *******************************************************************
        -->
    <p>In printed texts, the individual constituents of a bibliographic
        reference are conventionally marked off from each other and from the
        flow of text by such features as bracketing, italics, special
        punctuation conventions, underlining, etc. In electronic texts, such
        distinctions are also important, whether in order to produce acceptably
        formatted output or to facilitate intelligent retrieval processing,<note
            place="foot">For example, to distinguish
            <mentioned>London</mentioned> as an author's name from
                <mentioned>London</mentioned> as a place of publication or as a
            component of a title.</note> quite apart from the need to
        distinguish the reference itself as a textual object with particular
        linguistic properties. </p>
    <!--
            ************ Commented out of Epidoc version *******************
            
        <p>It should be emphasized that for references as for other textual
            features, the primary or sole consideration is not how the text
            should be formatted when it is printed. The distinctions permitted
            by the scheme outlined here may not necessarily be all that
            particular formatters or bibliographic styles require, although they
            should prove adequate to the needs of many such commonly used
            software systems.<note place="foot">Among the bibliographic software
                systems and subsystems consulted in the design of the
                    <gi>biblStruct</gi> structure were BibTeX, Scribe, and
                ProCite. The distinctions made by all three may be preserved in
                    <gi>biblStruct</gi> structures, though the nature of their
                design prevents a simple one-to-one mapping from their data
                elements to TEI elements. For further information, see section
                    <ptr target="#COBIOT"/>.</note> The features distinguished
            and described below (in section <ptr target="#COBICO"/>) constitute
           a set which has been useful for a wide range of bibliographic
            purposes and in many applications, and which moreover corresponds to
            a great extent with existing bibliographic and library cataloguing
            practice. For a fuller account of that practice as applied to
            electronic texts see section <ptr target="#HD3"/>; for a brief
            mention of related library standards see section <ptr target="#HD8"

    <!-- Epidoc Intro, based on TEI intro -->
    <p>Bibliographical entries can be encoded in several ways in an Epidoc
        document or corpus, depending on the complexity of the bibliography and
        of the document as a whole. It should be emphasized that for references
        as for other textual features, the primary or sole consideration is not
        how the text should be formatted when it is printed. In all cases,
        bibliographical information is enclosed in <tag>tei:div
            type="bibliography</tag>. If the encoded inscription is a single
        document, or a collection of just a few inscriptions, it is sufficient
        to encode full bibliographic entries inside <tag>div
        type="bibliography"</tag>. Larger corpora, or inscriptions that are part
        of a bigger project with shared bibliography are better off listing
        bibliography inside <tag>tei:div type="bibliography</tag> as a series of
        references pointing to bibliographic entries collected in a separate
        file. </p>
    <p>Bibliographical information may be associated with several different
        sections, such as commentary, history or apparatus criticus. These
        relationships are indicated by grouping bibliographic items in a
            <tag>listBibl</tag> for each section. Display of bibliographic
        information is controlled by the output software, and can occur either
        in the appropriate section or all together in a group. Bibliographic
        citations are also required in several places in the TEI header.</p>
    <p>Examples of different categories of bibliographical reference. <list>
            <item>bibliography supporting editions</item>
            <item>bibliography supporting discussions of text</item>
            <item>bibliography supporting commentary</item>
        </list>
    </p>
    <p>The rest of this section is based on the corresponding chapter of the TEI
        P5 Guidelines. Epidoc recommends using a subsection of the all possible
        bibliographic elements. Epidoc also recommends marking bibliography
        according to normal modern bibliographic practice, as well as using
        consistent short references to refer to bibliographic items.</p>
    <div3 type="subsection" xml:id="COBITY">
        <head>Elements of Bibliographic References</head>
        <p>The following elements are used to mark individual bibliographic
            references as wholes, or in groups:<specList>
                <specDesc key="bibl"/>
                <specDesc key="biblItem"/>
                <!--     <specDesc key="biblStruct"/>
                    <specDesc key="biblFull"/>  -->
                <specDesc key="listBibl"/>
            </specList> These elements all share a number of possible component
            sub-elements.
            <!-- For the <gi>bibl</gi> and
                <gi>biblStruct</gi> elements, exactly the same sub-elements are
                concerned, and they are described together in section <ptr
                    target="#COBICO"/>; for the <gi>biblFull</gi> element, the
                sub-elements concerned are fully described in section <ptr
                    target="#HD2"/>. -->
            For the <gi>bibl</gi> element, they are described in section <ptr
                target="#COBICO"/>, for <gi>biblItem</gi> they are described in
            section <ptr target="xx"/>. <gi>listBibl</gi> is described in
            section <ptr target="xx"/></p>
        <!--        <p>Different levels of specific tagging may be appropriate in
                different situations. In some cases, it may be felt necessary to
                mark just the extent of the reference itself, with perhaps a few
                distinctions being made within it (for example, between the part
                of the reference which identifies a title or author and the
                rest). Such references, containing a mixture of text with
                specialized bibliographic elements, are regarded as
                <gi>bibl</gi> elements, and tagged accordingly. For
                    example:<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                    <p>A book which had a great influence on him was
                            <bibl>Tufte's <title>Envisioning
                        Information</title></bibl>, although he may never have
                        actually read it.</p>
                </egXML> Indeed, some encoders may find it unnecessary to mark
                the bibliographic reference at all:<egXML
                    xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                    <p>A book which had a great influence on him was Tufte's
                            <title>Envisioning Information</title>, although he
                        may never have actually read it.</p>
                </egXML>
            </p>
            <p>Some bibliographic references are extremely elliptical, often
                only a string of the form <mentioned>Baxter, 1983</mentioned>.
                If no further details of Baxter's book are given in the source
                text and none are supplied by the encoder, then the reference
                thus given should be tagged as a<gi>bibl</gi>:<egXML
                    xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">All of this is of
                    course much more fully treated in <bibl>Baxter,
                    1983</bibl><![CDATA[.]]></egXML> In general, however, normal
                modern bibliographic practice, and these Guidelines, distinguish
                between a bibliographic <term rend="noindex">reference</term>,<index>
                    <term>references</term>
                    <index>
                        <term>bibliographic</term>
                    </index>
                </index><index>
                    <term>bibliographic references</term>
                </index> which is a self-sufficient description of a
                bibliographic item, and a bibliographic <term rend="noindex"
                    >pointer</term>,<index>
                    <term>bibliographic pointers</term>
                </index><index>
                    <term>pointers</term>
                    <index>
                        <term>bibliographic</term>
                    </index>
                </index> which is a short-form citation (e.g. <mentioned>Baxter,
                    1983</mentioned>) which serves usually as a place-holder or
                pointer to a full long-form reference found elsewhere in the
                text. The usual encoding of short-form references such as
                    <mentioned>Baxter, 1983</mentioned> is not as <gi>bibl</gi>
                elements but as cross-references to such elements; see section
                    <ptr target="#COBIXR"/> below. </p>
            <p>In cases where the encoder wishes to impose more structure on the
                bibliographic information, for example to make sure it conforms
                to a particular style-sheet or retrieval processor, the
                    <gi>biblStruct</gi> element should be used. Note that
                several of the features in this and later examples are explained
                later in the current section.<egXML

                of these elements as exist for a given reference must be
                distinguished, and must also be presented in a specific order,
                discussed further below (section <ptr target="#COBICOO"/>).-->
            The list of elements is exhaustive, and it is likely that only
            projects with a particular emphasis on bibliography will use all of
            them. </p>
        <div4 type="Section" xml:id="COBICOL">
            <head>Analytic, Monographic, and Series Levels</head>
            <p>In common library practice a clear distinction is made between an
                individual item within a larger collection and a free-standing
                book, journal, or collection. Similarly a book in a series is
                distinguished sharply from the series within which it appears.
                An article forming part of a collection which itself appears in
                a series thus has a bibliographic description with three quite
                distinct levels of information:<list type="ordered">
                    <item>the <term rend="noindex">analytic</term><index>
                            <term>analytic level</term>
                            <index>
                                <term>bibliographic</term>
                            </index>
                        </index> level, giving the title, author, etc., of the
                        article; </item>
                    <item>the <term rend="noindex">monographic</term><index>
                            <term>monographic level</term>

                            </index>
                        </index> level, giving the title, editor, etc., of the
                        collection; </item>
                    <item>the <term rend="noindex">series</term><index>

                            <index>
                                <term>bibliographic</term>
                            </index>
                        </index> level, giving the title of the series, possibly
                        the names of its editors, etc., and the number of the
                        volume within that series. </item>
                </list> In the same way, an article in a journal requires at
                least two levels of information: the analytic level describing
                the article itself, and the monographic level describing the
                journal. </p>
            <!--       <p>These three levels may be distinguished within a
                    <gi>bibl</gi> element, and must be distinguished within a
                        <gi>biblStruct</gi> element if present, by means of the
                    following tags:
                    <?tei winita
              <specList><specDesc key="analytic"/><specDesc key="monogr"/><specDesc key="series"/></specList> ?> 
               </p> -->
            <p>For purposes of TEI encoding, journals and anthologies are both
                treated as monographs; a journal title will thus be tagged as a
                    <gi>title level="j"</gi> element, or simply as a
                <gi>title</gi> within a <gi>monogr</gi> element. Individual
                articles in the journal or collected texts should be treated at
                    the<soCalled>analytic</soCalled> level. When an article has
                been printed in more than one journal or collection, the
                bibliographic reference may have more than one <gi>monogr</gi>
                element, each possibly followed by one or more <gi>series</gi>
                elements. A <gi>series</gi> element always relates to the most
                recently preceding <gi>monogr</gi> element. (Whether reprints of
                an article are treated in the same bibliographic reference or a
                separate one varies among different styles. Library lists
                typically use a different entry for each publication, while
                academic footnoting practice typically treats all publications
                of the same article in a single entry.) </p>

            <p>Bibliographic references typically begin with a statement of the
                title being cited and the names of those intellectually
                responsible for it. For articles in journals or collections,
                such statements should appear both for the analytic and for the
                monographic level. The following elements are provided for
                tagging such elements:<specList>
                    <specDesc key="title"/>
                    <specDesc key="author"/>

            <p>In bibliographic references, all titles should be tagged as such,
                whether analytic, monographic, or series titles. The single
                    element<gi>title</gi> is used for all these cases. When it
                appears directly within an <gi>analytic</gi>, <gi>monogr</gi>,
                or <gi>series</gi> element, <gi>title</gi> is interpreted as
                belonging to the appropriate level. When it appears elsewhere,
                its <att>level</att> attribute should be used to signal its
                bibliographic level. It is a semantic error to give a value for
                the <att>level</att> attribute which is inconsistent with the

                    <val>a</val> implies the analytic level; the
                values<val>m</val>, <val>j</val>, and <val>u</val> imply the
                monographic level; the value <val>s</val> implies the series
                level. Note, however, that the semantic error occurs only if the
                nested title is directly enclosed by the <gi>analytic</gi>,
                    <gi>monogr</gi>, or <gi>series</gi> element; if it is
                enclosed only indirectly, no semantic error need be present. For
                example, the analytic title may contain a monographic

            <p>Slightly more complex is the distinction made below among main,
                subordinate, and parallel titles, in an example from the same
                source (p. 63). The punctuation and the bibliographic analysis
                are those given in ANSI Z39.29-1977; the punctuation is in the
                style prescribed by the International Standard Bibliographic
                Description (ISBD).<note place="foot">The analysis is not wholly
                    unproblematic: as the text of the standard points out, the
                    first subordinate title is subordinate only to the parallel
                    title in French, while the second is subordinate to both the
                    English main title and the French parallel title, without
                    this relationship being made clear, either in the markup
                    given in the example or in the reference structure offered
                    by the standard.</note> Again, it is only because this
                example uses <gi>bibl</gi> rather than <gi>biblStruct</gi>, that
                specific punctuation may be included between the component

            <p>The elements <gi>author</gi> and <gi>editor</gi> have, for
                printed books and articles, a fairly obvious significance; for
                other kinds of bibliographic items their proper usage may be
                less obvious. The<gi>author</gi> element should be used for the
                person or agency with primary responsibility for a work's
                intellectual content, and the element <gi>editor</gi> for an
                editor of the work. Thus an organization such as a radio or
                television station is usually
                accounted<soCalled>author</soCalled> of a broadcast, for
                example, while the author of a Government report will usually be
                the agency which produced it. </p>
            <p>For anyone else with responsibility for the work,
                the<gi>respStmt</gi> element should be used. The nature of the
                responsibility is indicated by means of a <gi>resp</gi> element,
                and the person, organization, etc. responsible by a
                    <gi>name</gi>,<gi>persName</gi>, or <gi>orgName</gi>
                element. Strings such as<q>unknwon</q> may be encoded using the
                    <gi>rs</gi> element.
                <!-- I'm mildly unahppy with this <rs>unknown</rs>, as it's not really a noun, is it? -sb -->
                At least one of the four naming elements
                    (<gi>name</gi>,<gi>persName</gi>, <gi>orgName</gi>, or
                    <gi>rs</gi> &mdash; at present the TEI schema files also
                permit <gi>geogName</gi> and<gi>placeName</gi>, but these should
                not be used) and one<gi>resp</gi> element should be given within
                the <gi>respStmt</gi> element, followed optionally by any number
                of any of them.</p>
            <p>Examples of secondary responsibility of this kind include the
                roles of illustrator, translator, encoder, and annotator. The
                    <gi>respStmt</gi> element may also be used for editors, if
                it is desired to record the specific terms in which their role
                is described.</p>
            <p>Examples of <gi>author</gi> and <gi>editor</gi> may be found in
                sections <ptr target="#COBITY"/>, and <ptr target="#COBICOL"/>;
                    wherever<gi>author</gi> and <gi>editor</gi> may occur, the
                    <gi>respStmt</gi> element may also occur. When one of these
                elements precedes or immediately follows a title, it applies to
                that title; when it follows an <gi>edition</gi> element or
                occurs within an edition statement, it applies to the edition in
                question. </p>
            <p>In this example, the <gi>respStmt</gi> elements apply to the work
                as a whole, not merely to the first edition:<egXML

            <p>In this example, by contrast, the <gi>respStmt</gi> element

                and Tervooren were not responsible for the first thirty-five
                printings); the elements of the reference have been reordered
                from their appearance on the title page of the volume in order
                to ensure the correct relationship of the collection title, the

                organization by whose authority and in whose name a
                bibliographic entity such as a book is made public or
                distributed (whether a commercial publisher or some other
                organization), the place of publication, and a date. It may also
                include a full address for the publisher or organization. Full
                bibliographic references usually specify either the number of
                pages in a print publication (or equivalent information for
                non-print materials), or the specific location of the material
                being cited within its containing publication. The following
                elements are provided to hold this information:<specList>

                    <specDesc key="address"/>

            </p>
            <p>For bibliographic purposes, usually only the place (or places) of
                publication are required, possibly including the name of the
                country, rather than a full address; the element
                <gi>pubPlace</gi> is provided for this purpose. Where however
                the full postal address is likely to be of importance in
                identifying or locating the bibliographic item concerned, it may
                be supplied and tagged using the <gi>address</gi> element
                described in section <ptr target="#CONAAD"/>. Alternatively, if

            <p>A bibliographic description, particularly for an analytic title,
                will often include some additional information specifying its
                location, for example as a volume number, page number, range of
                page numbers, or name or number of a subdivision of the host
                work. The element<gi>biblScope</gi> may be used to identify such
                information if it is present. Where it is desired to distinguish
                different classes of such information (volume number, page
                number, chapter number, etc.), the<att>type</att> attribute may
                be used with any convenient typology. </p>
            <p>When the item being cited is a journal article, the
                <gi>imprint</gi> element describing the issue in which it
                appeared will typically contain<gi>biblScope</gi> elements for
                volume and page numbers, together with a<gi>date</gi> element. </p>

                <gi>bibl</gi>, or a nested entry that facilitates data entry,
            which uses the <gi>biblItem</gi> element.</p>
        <div4 type="Section" xml:id="COBIxx">
            <head>Traditional Bibliographic Entries</head>
            <p>This form of bibliographic entry is best suited to small corpora
                or publications of single inscriptions, where the bibliography
                for each inscription is contained within the <gi>div
                    type="bibliography"</gi> section. If bibliography for many
                inscriptions is collected into a single file, then this model is
                best suited when there aren't many entries.</p>
            <p>Traditional bibliography uses the bibliographic components, and
                just lists the author, title, publisher year and specific
                reference if there is one.</p>

            <head>Nested Bibliographic Entries</head>
            <p>Nested bibliographic items use the <gi>biblItem</gi> element.
                This element contains other <gi>biblItem</gi> elements, each of
                which has a role attribute describing its relationship to its
                containing element. The most common value will be "contained." <hi
                    rend="bold">EM: name is up for grabs.</hi>. The intent of this structure is to eliminate
                the need to retype entries for publications that contain other
                publication. So, in the case of journal article, the outermost
                    <gi>biblItem</gi> will document the journal, a second level
                    <gi>biblItem</gi> documents the volume, and the innermost
                    <gi>biblItem</gi> documents the article. Likewise for edited
                collections, the innermost <gi>biblItem</gi> represents the
                article, which is then contained by a <gi>biblItem</gi> representing the 
                volume.
                <hi rend="bold">EM: note that this element may disappear from P5, so
                we'll have to edit to make this section describe bibl, which will
                most likely take over its function. Also, need better description.</hi>

        <head>Bibliographic Pointers </head>
        <p>References which are pointers to bibliographic items, of whatever
            kind, should be treated in the same way as other cross-references
            (see section <ptr target="#COXR"/>). As discussed in that section,
            cross referencing within TEI texts is in general represented by
            means of<gi>ptr</gi> or <gi>ref</gi> elements. A <att>target</att>
            attribute on these elements is used to supply an identifying value
            for the target of the cross reference, which should be, in the case
            of bibliographic elements, a bibliographic reference of some kind.
            Where the form of the reference itself is unimportant, or may be
            reconstructed mechanically, or is not to be encoded, the
            <gi>ptr</gi> element is used, as in the following example:<egXML
                xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">As shown above (<ptr
                    target="#NEL80"/><![CDATA[) ...]]></egXML>
            It is best to avoid the use of the <gi>ptr</gi> element.
        </p>
        <p>Where the form of the reference is important, or contains additional
            qualifying information which is to be distinguished from
            the surrounding text, the <gi>ref</gi> element should be used, as in
            the following example:<egXML
                xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">CIL<ref
                    target="#CIL">II 345</ref><![CDATA[ ...]]></egXML>
           In this way, an overall bibliography may be maintained separately, and 
           references to it may be placed where they are necessary, without risking 
           typing errors and inconsistencies. The <attribute>target</attribute> points to 
           the id of the appropriate <gi>bibl</gi> or <gi>biblItem</gi>, and the content of
           the <attribute>ref</attribute> element contains a reference to a page or item number..
        </p>
        <!--Following suggestion is only possible if <biblScope> becomes a phrase. -->
        <!--Which it currently isnt.  -->
        <!--<p>When it is desired to distinguish the short form of the reference -->
        <!--itself from the additional qualifying information added to it, the -->
        <!--additional information may be marked as a <gi>biblScope</gi> element: -->
        <!--  -->
        <!--<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">-->
        <!--Nelson claims (<ref target='NEL80'>Nelson [1980], <biblScope>especially -->
        <!--pages 13&ndash;37</ref>) ... -->
        <!--]]> -->
        <!--</egXML> -->
        <!--  -->
        <!--(This distinction between the short form and the qualifying information -->
        <!--may be useful in the context of document production or normalization of -->
        <!--bibliographic references.) -->
        <!-- 
                    It may be important to
                distinguish between the short form of a bibliographic reference
                and some qualifying or additional information. The latter should
                not appear within the scope of the <gi>ref</gi> element when
                this is the case, as for example in an application concerned to
                normalize bibliographic references:<egXML
                    xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">Nelson claims (<ref
