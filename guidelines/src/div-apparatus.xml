   <p>Structuring comments on the epigraphic text (tei:div type="apparatus") </p>
   <p>Provides information on readings and conjectures. A portion of this is
      captured in the markup (test this), so it can be generated. But the
      apparatus criticus has to handle "out of line" or more general comments.
      Perhaps stubs can be created for each line that has conjectures in a
      CHET-C type conversion. This can then be edited by hand, the way CHET-C
      output is. There also needs to be a provision for plain text sections,
      which can appear interspersed with the more structured sections, or added to
      the line stubs.</p>
