        <head>The encoding of the guidelines, a technical description</head>
        <p>These <bibl><title level="m">Guidelines</title></bibl> embody more than prose and encoding examples for direct examination
            by human readers. They also contain carefully encoded data strings that are picked up
            and used by core EpiDoc software tools. As a result, the Guidelines function as the lone
            source from which the various converting and formatting mechanisms developed by the
            EpiDoc community draw the settings that specify their behavior, in particular with
            regard to mappings between traditional sigla for epigraphic transcription and the
            TEI/XML encodings specified by EpiDoc. Self-test mechanisms for the Guidelines, designed
            and implemented by Hugh Cayless during the <xref href="sprintsandstorm.xml">EpiDoc
                Sandstorm Development Sprint</xref> in London (March 2006), ensure that the
            behaviors of these tools remain reliably synchonized with each other, and with the
            encoding guidance and explanation the Guidelines provide to human readers.</p>
