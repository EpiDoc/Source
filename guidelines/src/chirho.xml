      <p>The distinctive ☧ can be interpreted and rendered in at
least three different ways. Since several Unicode characters closely
represent the symbol—no. 2627 (Greek chi rho), 2CE9 (Coptic chi rho), and
no. 2CE8 (Coptic tau rho—similar to the vertical cross chi rho)--it can be
easily represented in either of its characteristic forms as a single
character (☧, ⳩, ⳨), or it can be rendered as a ligature ☧, or it can be
spelled out ("chi-rho"). Similarly, as ☧ is used in ancient texts, it can
be understood in at least three different ways‹as a simple ligature, as an
abbreviation, and as a symbol (as in the examples above).</p><p>  For example:
 
[xp]hmata = ligature
[xp](isto)fer = abbreviation
[xp] = symbol (as, e.g., at the head of a Christian Latin epitaph where the
editor has reason to believe it was not originally understood as an
abbreviation for the word Ch(ristos) but simply as a symbol of the Christian
faith)</p><p>As always, the issues of semantic markup and rendering (output) are
independent and can be used in conjunction with each other to represent an
editor's interpretation of the {xp} in context in whatever fashion is
preferred. The simplest way to ensure consistent indexing and rendering
within a text (or series of texts) in which more than one of the
interpretations occurs is to embed within each semantic encoding of the {xp}
the full string of possible representations, and to have the xsl stylesheet
render each systematically according to its semantic interpretation. For
example, the ligature might be represented as {xp lig], the abbreviaton as
(chi-rho), and the symbol as {xp}.</p>
