        <p>This section describes the division in which the translation of the inscription is
            encoded.</p>
        <p>A minimal translation contains plain text rendering the inscription into the desired
            language.</p>
        <p>A project may also choose to tag the text features within the translation, in which case
            the detailed guidelines concerning the markup of traditionally transcribed issues are
            found under the heading of <xref id="taggingtext.xml">Tagging the Inscribed
        Text</xref>.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <head>Particulars</head>
        <p>An edition is tagged using the <tag>div @type='translation'</tag> element. There can be
            multiple translations of the same text, for example into different languages or by
            different translators; each translation should be enclosed in its own separate <tag>div
                @type='translation'</tag>.</p>
        <p>Authority for each translation is recorded in <note>where?</note>.</p>
