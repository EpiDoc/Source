    <head>Placenames and Geographic Names in the Text</head>
    <p>The marking of place names and geographic names in the text of an inscription
    is not required for EAGLE conformance; however, the value for indexing and subsequent
    processing is immense. Therefore, employing the following guidance is highly encouraged.</p>
    <p>To indicate the place of finding, last recorded location or presumed original location
    of an inscription, see <xref href="location.xml">Describing past and present locations of the inscribed object</xref>.</p>
    <p>As a minimum, place names should be tagged with the <tag>placeName</tag>
        tag (and region, river and similar non-localized names with <tag>geogName</tag>), as demonstrated below. In addition, the attributes 'reg' and 'key'
        may be used to offer normalised spelling and link to a database/authority
        list, respectively. The <tag>placename</tag> is used for indicating
        locations, usually when they appear in a grammatically nominal form. Where
        a place name appears in an adjectival form or as an ethnic designation,
        the name should be tagged as an <tag>rs</tag>. For more information see
        xx in P4.</p>
    <p>It is likely that an epigraphic or papyrological project will need to
        maintain a database or authority list containing basic topographical and
        geographical data on places named in the corpus. In addition to the tags
        and attributes suggested below, therefore, the individual names might be
        linked to the keys or ids in this controlled list.</p>
    <p>There exist various geographical databases and toponymical lists (such as
        the Barrington Atlas) that may provide keys for place names in
        inscriptions. For more information see the section/appendix on authority
        lists and controlled vocabularies (see <xref id="control.xml">Controlled
            Vocabulary</xref>). The controlled vocabulary being used should be
        indicated either in the header (<hi rend="strong">which section?</hi>) or
        using an <hi rend="strong">as yet undertermined</hi> new attribute on
        placeName.</p>
    <p>The full attribute that may be added to the placename attribute is used to
        mark names that are abbreviated or otherwise shortened. It seems unlikely
        that full is the correct attribute for place names that were inscribed in
        full but are now fragmentary.</p>
