      <p>This section describes the encoding of pictorial and other non-textual
         material that can accompany and support the documentation of an
         inscription. This kind of material may include photographs of the
         object or of its location, drawings of the object or older handwritten
         transcriptions or scans of squeezes. This is also the place to
         insert other non-textual objects, such as sound files, animations or movies, 3D visualisation objects, SVG, etc.</p>
      <p>The detailed guidelines concerning the markup of images and other
         non-textual material may be found at [[possibly P4, 22.3]]</p>
