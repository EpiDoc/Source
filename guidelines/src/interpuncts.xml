   <p>Dohnicht, pp. 4-5 discusses sigla for interpuncts and various associated issues; Panciera does not address. There was much disagreement
       at the first epidoc workshop about how and whether interpuncts should be encoded. We need to have option(s) - what should they be?</p>
    <p>Inter-word and inter-syllabic punction must both be addressed - Dohnicht makes the semantic distinction, but uses the same symbol (a hollow middle dot)</p><p>Any marker sign dividing words or syllables and used to distinguish between them. Characteristically interpuncts appear at mid-line and take the form of triangles, squares, points; small ivy leaves may also be used for this purpose (hederae distinguentes). See Di Stefano, Mestiere 13.9.4.</p>
