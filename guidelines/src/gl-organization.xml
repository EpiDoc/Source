        <head>Organization of the Guidelines: where to go from here</head>
        <p>These Guidelines are organized into several chapters reflecting the major procedural steps that lead to
            a published epigraphic edition. Each of these chapters is further subdivided so as to provide discrete sections for
            each distinct activity or semantic distinction made in standard epigraphic practice. An appendex, dealing with
            a range of technical matters, follows these thematic chapters. Its contents are referenced as necessary in the
            appropriate chapters.
        </p>
            <p>To do: How does this arrangement help you? How should you get started?</p>
