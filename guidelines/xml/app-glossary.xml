        <label xml:id="encoding">Encoding</label>
        <item>Encoding in this context means the conversion of human-readable information into
            machine-readable information, e.g. in the form of XML.</item>

        <label xml:id="leiden">Leiden, Leiden Conventions</label>
        <item>A set of rules for the encoding of classical epigraphic and papyrological texts using
            simple, arbitrary and unambiguous symbols to represent editorial observations and
            interventions, e.g. '[' and ']' for lost text (restored or lacuna). There are several
            minor variations on Leiden now in use (<ref target="app-epi-panciera.html"
                >Krummrey-Panciera</ref> and <ref target="app-epi-petrae.html">PETRAE</ref> perhaps
            prominent among them). A good summary of Leiden can be found at <ref
                target="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden_Conventions"
                >en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden_Conventions</ref></item>

        <label xml:id="leidenplus">Leiden+ (Leiden-plus)</label>
        <item>Leiden+ is a system of text markup, based very closely on <term target="#leiden"
                >Leiden</term> but including new signs and combinations for complex apparatus
            markup, for example, devised for the Papyrological Editor's "tags-free" editing
            environment. Full description and documentation of Leiden+ is at <ref
                target="http://papyri.info/editor/help">papyri.info/editor/help</ref>.</item>
        
        <label xml:id="markup">Markup</label>
        <item>Markup language in a way to encode a text's contents in order to enable different ways
            of representation and e.g. to extract information to be collected for indexes, or search
            tools (cf. <ref target="#encoding">Encoding</ref>).<lb/> "Markup" is sometimes also used
            as shorthand for <ref target="https://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/wiki/MarkupList/">the
                Markup List</ref>, an email list for the discussion of EpiDoc and other ancient text
            markup matters.</item>
        
        <label xml:id="morpheus">Morpheus</label>
        <item>The Morpheus morphological analysis service is a tool originally developed by <ref
                target="#perseus">Perseus</ref>, versions of which are in use by Papyri.info and the
            TLG for lemmatizing their Greek texts. The Perseus version of the tool also caters for
            Latin and Arabic lemmatization. [<ref

        <label xml:id="perseus">Perseus</label>
        <item><ref target="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu">The Perseus Digital Library Project</ref>
            studies the progression from physical to digital libraries and offers an increasing
            number of texts. Searches and a number of tools can be used directly on the website
            while reading, e.g. a <ref target="#morpheus">dictionary tool</ref> for Greek and Latin
            texts.</item>
        
        <label xml:id="TEI">TEI</label>
        <item>Text Encoding Initiative. Guidelines and tools for the encoding of literary and
            historical texts in <ref target="#xml">XML</ref>. It is the format on which EpiDoc is
            based. The latest TEI Guidelines can be found online at <ref

        <label xml:id="w3c">World Wide Web Consortium</label>
        <item>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community developing standards
            to be used across the Internet. The public can take part, but there is also full-time
            staff and entire organizations that are members of the endeavour. For further
            information, see: www.w3.org.</item>
        
        <label xml:id="xml">XML</label>
        <item>Extensible Markup Language. A text-based encoding format that allows the structured
            encoding of text or data in human- and machine-readable format. It is the technical
            basis of both <ref target="#TEI">TEI</ref> and EpiDoc, and is a standard maintained by
            the World-wide Web Consortium. See <ref target="http://www.w3.org/XML/"
                >www.w3.org/XML</ref> for the spec and further description.</item>
        
        <label xml:id="xslt">XSLT</label>
        <item>Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations. XSLT is a language that can convert
                <ref target="#xml">XML</ref> documents into either different XML or other forms,
            e.g. the HTML format used for websites. A useful introduction to XSLT is offered by <ref
