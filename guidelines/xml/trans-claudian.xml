    <head>Claudian letters</head>
    <p>Three characters created by the Emperor Claudius to represent sounds or sound combinations that were not unambiguously represented
        by existing Latin characters: &#x2183;(Unicode 2183: antisigma, representing PS or BS); &#x2C75; (Unicode 2C75: sonus medius, 
        representing vowel bwteen U and I; later represented with Y); &#x2132; (Unicode 2132: digamma inversum, representing consonantal U).</p>
    <p><specList>
        <specDesc key="g"/>
    </specList></p> 
    
    <p>Before these characters were represented by Unicode codepoints, Latin epigraphers were in the habit of transcribing these using the Latin 
        characters to which they correspond (PS, BS, Y or V respectively). When transcribing such an edition, <gi>g</gi> should be used with the
        expansion in the <att>type</att> (preceded by "claudian_"). When the character itself is simply included in a Latin word, the Unicode character
        may simply be included in the text with no markup. Or <gi>g</gi> might be wrapped around the Unicode character.</p>
    <p>It might also be a good idea, for the sake of indexing and parsing words, to regularize (using <gi>choice</gi>, <gi>orig</gi> and <gi>reg</gi>)
        words containing these letters to their more conventional Latin spellings (see final example below, and cf.
       <ref target="trans-regularization.html">Regularization</ref>).</p>
