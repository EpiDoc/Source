    <head>Titles, offices, political posts, honorifics, occupations</head>
    <p>Tagging of different types of offices, posts, and other titles in the transcribed text or elsewhere,
    usually for the purposes of indexing or searching the corpus.</p>
    <p>
        <specList>
            <specDesc key="w"/>
            <specDesc key="rs"/>
        </specList>
    </p>
    
    <p>There are two broad methods for generating indices of titles, occupations and the like in an EpiDoc edition:</p>
    
    <p>(1) Using a defined list of lemmatized words, and drawing these from the general word list
    (assuming words are lemmatized in the first place). A specific indexer could pull terms such as
        <foreign xml:lang="la">consul, comes, beneficarius, quaestor</foreign>,
        <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχών, εὐτυχὴς, σχολαστικός</foreign> into themed indices of
        titles and the like. If words are explicitly lemmatized in the text (as in the example below, using
        the <att>lemma</att> attribute of the <gi>w</gi> element) no extra
    encoding is needed; alternatively the lemmata might be pulled from a list generated from the texts
    by a tool such as <term target="#morpheus">Morpheus</term>.</p>
    
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <w lemma="consul"><expan><abbr>co</abbr><ex>n</ex><abbr>s</abbr><ex>ul</ex></expan></w>
        </egXML>
    
    <p>(2) Another more explicit way to tag titulature in a transcribed text might be to use the 
        <gi>rs</gi> element with a defined <att>type</att> attribute, to encode arbitrary categories of
        <ref target="idx-keywords.html">terms and keywords</ref> within the text, regardless of their language,
        spelling or expression. In this case, ideally a <att>ref</att> or <att>key</att> attribute would point to an
        <ref target="idx-other.html">authority list</ref> elsewhere in the project.</p>
