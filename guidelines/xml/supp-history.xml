    <p>EpiDoc provides for both detail and flexibility in describing what is known or recorded about the origin and
        subsequent history of a text-bearing object. As described in the <ref
            target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/MS.html#mshy">History Section of the TEI
            Guidelines</ref>, this information is collected in a <gi>history</gi> element that is part of the
            <gi>msDesc</gi> in the <gi>teiHeader</gi>. Within <gi>history</gi>, one first encodes an <gi>origin</gi>
        element, which is used to lay out what is known about the date(s) and location(s) associated with the original
        (historic) creation and publication of the object (the <gi>origDate</gi> and <gi>origPlace</gi> elements are
        provided for each of these purposes). After the <gi>origin</gi> element, the editor may create one or more <gi>provenance</gi> elements, each of which
        describes a discrete event in the history of the object, capturing whatever is known and relevant in the way of
        temporal and spatial information. Examples of provenance events include: (modern) place and date of finding or
        subsequent observation and recording.</p>
    <p>Here is an example adapted from the 
        <ref target="http://insaph.kcl.ac.uk/iaph2007/">Inscriptions of Aphrodisias</ref> project:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <history>
            <origin>
                <origDate>Second to third centuries C.E.</origDate>
                <origPlace><placeName type="ancient">Aphrodisias</placeName>: probably in the grounds of the 
                    Temple of Aphrodite.</origPlace>
            </origin>
            <provenance type="found" when="1968">
                <p>Re-used in the City Walls of <placeName type="ancient">Aphrodisias</placeName>.</p>
            </provenance>
            <provenance type="observed" when="2012">
                <p>Aphrodisias Museum.</p>
            </provenance>
        </history>
    </egXML>
    <p>If detailed historical, dating and provenance information is not known (e.g. for an object or manuscript long
        held in a repository or private collection), a general description of the history of the object may be given in
        one or more <gi>p</gi> element (as shown below) rather than using the structured elements described above.</p>

    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <history>
            <p>The stone may have been in the private collection of Pr Cresson, who invited Louis Robert to read and
                translate the inscription. Robert recorded no information on its provenance and its later whereabouts
                are unknown. It has never emerged on the antiquities market.</p>
        </history>
    </egXML>

    <p>More detailed discussion and specific examples (e.g., for dealing with a range of possible places of origin or
        fragmentary objects whose component parts have been separated in modern times) see the following sections of the
        guidelines:</p>
    <list>
        <item><ref target="supp-historigdate.html">Date of origin</ref></item>
        <item><ref target="supp-historigin.html">Place of origin</ref></item>
        <item><ref target="supp-histlocations.html">Dates and locations of modern observations</ref>: <list>
                <item><ref target="supp-histfound.html">Context of discovery (findspot)</ref></item>
                <item><ref target="supp-histmodern.html">Other documented modern observations, including last known location</ref></item>
            </list>
        </item>
    </list>
    <p>Note that inventory numbers, repository information and related indicia are treated in a separate part of
            <gi>msDesc</gi> (a sibling element of <gi>history</gi> called <gi>msIdentifier</gi>). The encoding of this
        information is described in the <ref target="supp-histinvno.html">Inventory numbers and repositories</ref>
        section.</p>
