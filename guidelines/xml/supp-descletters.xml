        The description of hand(s) may include information on letterforms and heights (or other dimensions, such
        as line-heights), palaeographic features including dating, ligatures, abbreviation marks, unusual characters
        and other symbols or textual features. On the whole only letterheights are tagged in this section (with
        <gi>height</gi>), although dating may also be marked in principle (if it is different from the information
        recorded in <gi>origDate</gi>).
    </p>
    <p>  
        Ligatures, while sometimes listed here manually, may be better captured
        by tagging in the transcribed text as <gi>hi</gi> with <att>rend</att> of "ligature" and mechanically
        generating a list of instances in the output. See also <ref target="trans-ligature.html">Ligatures</ref>.
    </p>    
    <p>
        If multiple hands are described, each should be given a separate <gi>handNote</gi>, each bearing either
        an <att>n</att> (corresponding to a numbered section in the transcribed text), or an <att>xml:id</att>
        to which a <gi>handShift</gi> element in the transcription may point.
        See also <ref target="trans-handshift.html">Change of hand or scribe</ref>.

    <p>See also <ref target="supp-descdimensions.html">Dimensions</ref> for more information on tagging object, campus or letter dimensions.</p>
