    <head>Appendix: Glossary</head>
 
    <list type="gloss">
        <label xml:id="crosswalk">Crosswalk, crosswalking</label>
        <item>A general term for moving data from the format of one encoding scheme or database
        to another. In EpiDoc terms, it often refers to the dynamic transformation of
        the semantic distinctions of epigraphic and papyrological editions between EpiDoc XML and
        one or more database of texts or catalogue records. These "crosswalks" may take place in either direction, or
        in some cases in both directions and reversible without loss of information.
        Prominent crosswalks performed by the EpiDoc community include: 
        the conversion of <term target="#IRT">IRT</term> from EpiDoc to the database
        format of <term target="#EDH">EDH</term>;
            the migration of the <term target="#ddb">Duke Databank</term>,
        <term target="#hgv">HGV</term> and <term target="#apis">APIS</term> content to EpiDoc as part of the
            Papyri.info project (the HGV-to-EpiDoc is lossless and bidirectional);
            the current conversion of the <term target="#eagle">EAGLE</term> constituent
            databases into EpiDoc XML as part of the <ref target="http://www.eagle-network.eu/">EAGLE Europeana</ref>
        project.</item>
        
        <label xml:id="encoding">Encoding</label>
        <item>Encoding in this context means the conversion of human-readable information into
            machine-readable information, e.g. in the form of <term target="#xml">XML</term>.</item>

        <label xml:id="epidoc-stylesheets">EpiDoc Example Stylesheets</label>
        <item>Software code, written in the Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL or <term
                target="#xslt">XSLT</term>), and intended for use in transforming EpiDoc XML files
            into other formats (chiefly text and HTML) using a range of standard typographical
            conventions (e.g., <term target="#leiden">Leiden</term>). Documentation and further
            information are to be found on the <ref
                target="https://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/wiki/Stylesheets/">Stylesheets page in the
                EpiDoc Wiki</ref>.</item>

        <label xml:id="epidoc-schema">EpiDoc Schema</label>
        <item>A formally structured set of rules that tells an XML editor or processor what elements,
            attributes and other content are available in an EpiDoc file and how these are to be
            structured. Documentation and further information are to be found on the <ref
                target="https://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/wiki/Schema/">Schema page in the EpiDoc
                Wiki</ref>.</item>

        <label xml:id="leiden">Leiden, Leiden Conventions</label>
        <item>A set of rules for the encoding of classical epigraphic and papyrological texts using
            simple, arbitrary and unambiguous symbols to represent editorial observations and
            interventions, e.g. '[' and ']' for lost text (restored or lacuna). There are several
            minor variations on Leiden now in use (<ref target="app-epi-panciera.html"
                >Krummrey-Panciera</ref> and <ref target="app-epi-petrae.html">PETRAE</ref> perhaps
            prominent among them). A good summary of Leiden can be found at <ref
                target="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden_Conventions"
                >en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden_Conventions</ref></item>

        <label xml:id="leidenplus">Leiden+ (Leiden-plus)</label>
        <item>Leiden+ is a system of text markup, based very closely on <term target="#leiden"
                >Leiden</term> but including new signs and combinations for complex apparatus markup,
            for example, devised for the Papyrological Editor's "tags-free" editing environment. Full
            description and documentation of Leiden+ is at <ref
                target="http://papyri.info/editor/help">papyri.info/editor/help</ref>.</item>

        <label xml:id="markup">Markup</label>
        <item>Markup language in a way to encode a text's contents in order to enable different ways
            of representation and e.g. to extract information to be collected for indexes, or search
            tools (cf. <term target="#encoding">Encoding</term>).<lb/> "Markup" is sometimes also used
            as shorthand for <ref target="https://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/wiki/MarkupList/">the
                Markup List</ref>, an email list for the discussion of EpiDoc and other ancient text
            markup matters.</item>

        <label xml:id="morpheus">Morpheus</label>
        <item>The Morpheus morphological analysis service is a tool originally developed by <term
                target="#perseus">Perseus</term>, versions of which are in use by Papyri.info and the
            TLG for lemmatizing their Greek texts. The Perseus version of the tool also caters for
            Latin and Arabic lemmatization. (More information at <ref
                target="https://wikihub.berkeley.edu/display/pbamboo/Morphological+Analysis+Service+Contract+Description+-+v1.1.1"

        <item><ref target="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu">The Perseus Digital Library Project</ref>
            studies the progression from physical to digital libraries and offers an increasing
            number of texts. Searches and a number of tools can be used directly on the website while
            reading, e.g. the <term target="#morpheus">Morpheus</term> dictionary tool for Greek and Latin
            texts.</item>
        
        <label xml:id="pleiades">Pleiades</label>
        <item>A gazetteer of places and place names from the ancient world, building on the project that produced
            the Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World. Pleiades assigns unique identifiers to all places,
            enabling a web of Linked Data such as that curated by the
            <ref target="http://pelagios-project.blogspot.com/">Pelagios project</ref>. Pleiades can be found at

        <item>Text Encoding Initiative. Guidelines and tools for the encoding of literary and
            historical texts in <term target="#xml">XML</term>. It is the format on which EpiDoc is
            based. The latest TEI Guidelines can be found online at <ref

        <label xml:id="w3c">World Wide Web Consortium</label>
        <item>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community developing standards
            to be used across the Internet. The public can take part, but there is also full-time
            staff and entire organizations that are members of the endeavour. For further
            information, see: www.w3.org.</item>

        <label xml:id="xml">XML</label>
        <item>Extensible Markup Language. A text-based encoding format that allows the structured
            encoding of text or data in human- and machine-readable format. It is the technical basis
            of both <term target="#TEI">TEI</term> and EpiDoc, and is a standard maintained by the
            World-wide Web Consortium. See <ref target="http://www.w3.org/XML/">www.w3.org/XML</ref>
            for the spec and further description.</item>

        <label xml:id="xslt">XSLT</label>
        <item>Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations. XSLT is a language that can convert
                <term target="#xml">XML</term> documents into either different XML or other forms, e.g.
            the HTML format used for websites, the import format for a database, or the Open Document Format
            behind a word-processing document. The <term target="#epidoc-stylesheets">EpiDoc Stylesheets</term>
            are an example of XSLT used to transform EpiDoc XML to common display formats.
            A useful introduction to XSLT is offered by <ref
