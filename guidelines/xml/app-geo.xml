    <head>Dates and locations of modern observations</head>
    <p>NB: Guidance for encoding information about the original and historical disposition of the text-bearing object is
        provided in the sections on <ref target="supp-historigin.html">Original location of the text-bearing object</ref>
        and <ref target="supp-historigdate.html">Original date of text and/or object</ref>.</p>
    <p>It is customary in producing an edition of a pre-modern manuscript, papyrus, inscription, and the like to
        enumerate the occasions on which modern persons encountered and reported seminal information about the
        text-bearing object, its condition and disposition, etc., together with associated bibliographic reference. The
        initial such observation is often the occasion of finding, sometimes in situ, sometimes in circumstances or
        reuse, sometimes already in the context of a modern collection. There follow other observations, culminating in
        the "last observed location" or "current location."</p>
    <p>Following general TEI guidance, EpiDoc treats each such observation as a discrete event in space and time, and
        encodes each in a separate <gi>provenance</gi> element in the <gi>history</gi> section of the header. The
            <att>type</att> attribute is used with the following standard values to distinguish the major types of
        events:</p>
    <list>
        <item><tag>provenance type="found"</tag> is used to encode information about the initial modern observation of a
            text-bearing object</item>
        <item><tag>provenance type="observed"</tag> is used to encode information about subsequent modern
            observations</item>
        <item><tag>provenance type="autopsy"</tag> is a special case of <tag>provenance type="observed"</tag> that is
            used to encode a modern observation event during which the editor (i.e., the person creating the present
            edition) personally examined the object</item>
    </list>
    <p>Locations may be tagged in various contexts in the description of the text-bearing object: in <gi>origPlace</gi>,
            <gi>provenance</gi> (for find-place or modern locations). This page describes the issues that all of these
        locations share, rather than duplicating them in each section. </p>
    <p>
        <specList>
            <specDesc key="place"/>
            <specDesc key="placeName"/>
            <specDesc key="geogName"/>
        </specList>
    </p>
    <p>Placenames and geognames can be identified in several different ways. One way is with a <gi>ref</gi> which points
        to the an internal gazetteer. Another option is to link to an external database (<ref
            target="http://pleiades.stoa.org/">Pleiades</ref>, <ref target="http://www.geonames.org/"
        >Geonames</ref>).</p>

    <p>For specific types of placenames see the following subsections: </p>
    <list>
        <item><ref target="supp-historigin.html">original location</ref></item>
        <item><ref target="supp-histfound.html">place of finding</ref></item>
        <item><ref target="supp-histmodern.html">modern locations</ref></item>
    </list>
