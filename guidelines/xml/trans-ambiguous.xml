<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="trans-ambiguous" xml:lang="en">
    <head>Ambiguous Characters (Leiden underdotted)</head>
    <p>Character of which at least traces survive, but not adequately to identify the letter
        unambiguously outside of its context.</p>
    <p>
        <specList>
            <specDesc key="unclear"/>
        </specList>
    </p>

    <p>An incomplete or ill-executed character whose interpretation would be ambiguous outside of
        its context (traditionally rendered with an underdot in Leiden) should be tagged using the
            <gi>unclear</gi> element. (Cf. <ref target="trans-damaged.html">Damaged but not
            ambiguous characters</ref>.)</p>

    <p>The <gi>unclear</gi> element may be given the attribute <att>reason</att>, but this is not
        required by EpiDoc, as the use of the <gi>unclear</gi> element is sufficient to meet the
        distinctions that the Leiden conventions make.</p>

    <p>It is important to note that the EpiDoc use of the <gi>unclear</gi> element is very
        significantly more restricted than the default TEI definition, which allows for a large
        variety of elements to appear within <gi>unclear</gi>. For example, default TEI would allow
            <gi>unclear</gi> to contain elements such as <gi>persName</gi>, <gi>date</gi>,
            <gi>num</gi>, and <gi>choice</gi>. In EpiDoc, because the category "unclear" refers to
        the physical state of specific characters on the support, and not to editorial ambiguity or
        uncertainty about the interpretation of words or names, for example, <hi rend="italic"
            >only</hi> character data or a <gi>g</gi> tag may appear inside the <gi>unclear</gi>
        element. Stretches of ambiguous text that span words, lines, names, dates, or other tagged
        features, should therefore be marked with multiple <gi>unclear</gi> elements.</p>
