    <head>Damaged characters</head>
    <p>Character or characters on the source document having suffered some kind of damage
        which does not necessarily impede its interpretation or legibility.</p>
    <p>
        <specList>
            <specDesc key="damage"/>

    <p>Characters damaged on the source document, but not sufficiently ambiguous to
        require tagging as <gi>unclear</gi> may if desired be tagged with the <gi>damage</gi> element.</p>

    <p>There is not strictly any Leiden equivalent to the category of damaged but perfectly legible characters.
        Although some scholars have used the underdot indiscriminately for damaged characters whether 
        they are legible or ambiguous outside of their context, this is not generally recommended in epigraphic
        or papyrological practice. Encoding damaged characters distinctly is therefore an optional feature, not
        core to the Leiden distinctions that EpiDoc aims to reflect, and may be adopted at the discretion of
        individual projects. There is currently no recommended rendering for this feature, and it is not handled
        in the <term target="#epidoc-stylesheets">EpiDoc Example Stylesheets</term>. </p>
    
    <p>One reason for tagging damaged characters explicitly might be to enable the linking of parts of
        the support to images (as encoded in the <gi>facsimile</gi> element) using a <att>facs</att> attribute.</p>

    <p>Further, a larger span of damage that includes both legible and illegible characters and even
        lacunae might be contained in a single <gi>damage</gi> element, which would then include
        <gi>unclear</gi>, <gi>supplied</gi> and other tags within it.</p>
