    <p>Words divided across lines (i.e. where the line-break does not indicate a word-break) 
        should be indicated by <gi>lb</gi> with a <att>break</att> with a value of "no".
        This, among other things, allows the XSLT to generate the hyphen at the end of the preceding line. For further explanation of the <gi>lb</gi> element, see the guidance for <ref target="trans-linebreak.html">Line Breaks</ref>.</p>
