    <head>Previous Editor</head>
    <p>Letters read by a previous modern observer, but which cannot now be read.</p>
    <p><specList>
            <specDesc key="supplied"/>

    <p>The text which was visible to a previous editor but is now lost or illegible should be indicated
        with a <gi>supplied</gi> element with <att>evidence</att> with a value of "previouseditor".</p>
    <p>In most epigraphic/papyrological styles this text will be displayed with underline only (similarly to 
        <ref target="trans-parallel.html">Parallel Copy</ref>), and so it is largely academic whether the required
        <att>reason</att> attribute has a value of "lost" or the more generic "undefined", but in the Duke Databank
        the text may also be enclosed in square brackets to indicate the fact that  the text is now completely lost
        (as opposed to merely unclear, corrupt or uncertain).
