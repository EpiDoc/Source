    <p>Information describing the physical aspects of an inscription is encoded in the <gi>physDesc</gi> element, which is part of
        the <gi>teiHeader</gi>. The following subsections of these guidelines address specific aspects of this encoding:</p>
    <list>
        <item><ref target="supp-descobject.html">Description and dimensions of monument or object</ref></item>
        <item><ref target="supp-desctext.html">Description and layout of text field or campus</ref></item>
        <item><ref target="supp-descletters.html">Description of letters or hands</ref></item>
        <item><ref target="supp-descdecor.html">Decoration or iconography</ref></item>
        <item><ref target="supp-descdimensions.html">Dimensions (of object, campus or letters)</ref></item>
    </list>
    
    <p>
        If, rather than breaking down the description of various aspects of the support, the editor prefers a single 
        unstructured prose passage describing the object, the <gi>physDesc</gi> may contain one or more <gi>p</gi>
        (paragraph) elements as an alternative to (but not in addition to) the structured elements described in the
        sections linked above.
