    <head>Erased and Lost</head>
    <p>Text deliberately erased in antiquity of which no trace now remains on the stone or papyrus, 
        and which cannot be restored by the editor.</p>
    <p>
        <specList>
            <specDesc key="del"/>
            <specDesc key="gap"/>
        </specList>
    </p>
    
    <p>Two different TEI tags are used to indicate erased and un-restored text: the <gi>del</gi> element
    indicates the editor's assertion than the text was purposefully erased by an ancient hand (rather than, say,
    damaged by accident, weather or modern activity); the <gi>gap</gi> element indicates more objectively
    that whatever text or other decoration was originally inscribed on this surface is no longer evident at all.</p>

    <p>Characters erased in antiquity and completely lost should therefore be tagged using the <gi>del</gi>
        element (if appropriate assigning to the <att>rend</att> attribue a value, most likely "erasure"). A <gi>gap</gi>
        element should be placed inside the <gi>del</gi>, to indicate that the erased text is not restored,
        and will be given a <att>reason</att>, <att>unit</att>, and either <att>quantity</att> or <att>extent</att> 
        attributes, as usual.</p>
