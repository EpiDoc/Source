    <p>Recording in an edition the past and present inventory and catalog numbers associated with a text-bearing object
        can provide users of the edition essential information for locating the object for autopsy and for correlating
        references in publications and archival materials. Accordingly, TEI/EpiDoc requires some kind of manuscript
        identifier (<gi>msIdentifier</gi>) to be encoded as part of the manuscript description in any edition, as
        described in the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/MS.html#msid">TEI Guidelines
            section on the manuscript identifier</ref> and illustrated in the examples below.</p>
    <p>Whenever possible, the
            <gi>msIdentifier</gi> will include information about the name and location of the instition or repository
        holding the object (using the <gi>settlement</gi> and <gi>repository</gi> elements), along with its inventory
        number (<gi>idno</gi>) and/or conventional name (<gi>msName</gi>). When the text-bearing object is not held in an
        institutional, civic, or site collection, as is often the case with inscriptions, it may only be possible to
        provide very minimal information. When a research institution has compiled and maintained a regional or thematic
        inventory for materials that are spread across a range of institutions or sites, this number may be preferred
        and the individual institutional, expedition, or site inventory numbers recorded also with the
            <gi>altIdentifier</gi> element. Note that, in the absence of an institutional inventory number (or to
        augment the institutional information provided) an <gi>altIdentifer</gi> may be added with <tag>idno
            type="URI"</tag> pointing to a Wikipedia article or other stable web resource about the object.</p>
    
    <p>The following example illustrates the use of the <gi>settlement</gi>, <gi>repository</gi> and <gi>idno</gi>
        elements in a minimal inventory declaration for an item in a controlled collection:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <msIdentifier>
            <settlement>Sevastopol</settlement>
            <repository>National Preserve of Tauric Chersonesos (НЗХТ)</repository>
            <idno>80/36504</idno>
        </msIdentifier>
    </egXML>
    
    <p>This next example treats the famous Rosetta Stone, expanding on the approach used above by providing the 
        conventional name for the inscription, as well as a prior inventory number once used by the museum:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <msIdentifier>
            <settlement>London</settlement>
            <repository>The British Museum</repository>
            <idno>E24</idno>
            <msName>The Rosetta Stone</msName>
            <altIdentifier>
                <idno>BS.24</idno>
            </altIdentifier>
        </msIdentifier>
    </egXML>
    
    <p>The following example treats a free-standing monument (Trajan's Column) and illustrates the optional use of a
        Wikipedia URI to augment the information provided in the main portion of the <gi>msIdentifer</gi> element:</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <msIdentifier>
            <settlement>Rome</settlement>
            <msName>The Column of Trajan</msName>
            <altIdentifier>
                <idno type="URI">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan's_Column</idno>
            </altIdentifier>
        </msIdentifier>
    </egXML>
    
    <p>The following example, drawn from the <ref target="http://isaw.nyu.edu/publications/inscriptions/campa/">Corpus
            of the Inscriptions of Campā</ref>, illustrates several advanced, optional features in the encoding of
        object identifiers. These include:</p>
    <list>
        <item>the use for primary inventory number and "collection" of a regional/thematic inventory compiled by an
            institution (in this case the inventory of Campā inscriptions maintained by the École française
            d'Extrême-Orient or EFEO)</item>
        <item>the assignment of <att>xml:id</att> attribute values to some of the inventory numbers so that they can be
            connected (using e.g., <gi>ref</gi>) to bibliographic listings and commentary elsewhere in the edition as
            needed, and to support index generation</item>
        <item>use of <att>type</att> values on <gi>altIdentifier</gi> to organize and distinguish them </item>
    </list>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <msIdentifier>
            <institution>EFEO</institution>
            <idno xml:id="inv-general">C. 152</idno>
            <altIdentifier type="cancelled">
