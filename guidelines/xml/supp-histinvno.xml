    <p>Recording the holding institution of a manuscript or text-bearing object and inventory number

    <p>The TEI requires some kind of manuscript identifier (<gi>msIdentifier</gi>) to be encoded as
        part of the manuscript description in any edition, either institution plus identifier
        (<gi>repository</gi>+<gi>idno</gi>), or a generic manuscript name (<gi>msname</gi>). For epigraphy, where
        many objects are not held or catalogued by institutions but may be in situ, stray, in private collections
        or even lost, we may need to apply these definitions loosely in order to complete these elements.
