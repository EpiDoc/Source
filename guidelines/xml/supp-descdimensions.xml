    <head>Dimensions of object or campus</head>
    <p>The <gi>dimensions</gi> element, generally placed within the <gi>support</gi> or 
        <gi>layout</gi> or their descendents, may be used to record the dimensions, in any appropriate
        unit, of the monument, support, fragment, text field, or other aspect of the text or object being described.</p>

        <specList>

    <p>The most common uses for dimensions in an epigraphic/papyrological edition are to record (a) the dimensions
        of the text-bearing object, usually giving height, width and depth/thickness, or (b) those of the text field,
        usually giving only height and width. For these the TEI element <gi>dimensions</gi> should be used;
        this element must contain <emph>only</emph> the individual elements <gi>height</gi>, <gi>width</gi>
        and <gi>depth</gi> (or, for dimensions other than the three linear ones, <gi>dim</gi>, which may take an
        <att>type</att> such as "diameter", "arc", etc.).</p>
