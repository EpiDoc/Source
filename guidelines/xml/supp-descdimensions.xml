    <p>The <gi>dimensions</gi> element, generally placed within the <gi>support</gi> or 
        <gi>layout</gi> or their descendents, may be used to record the dimensions, in any appropriate
        unit, of the monument, support, fragment, text field, or other aspect of the text or object being described.</p>

    <div>
    <p>The most common uses for dimensions in an epigraphic/papyrological edition are to record (a) the dimensions
        of the text-bearing object, usually giving height, width and depth/thickness, or (b) those of the text field,
        usually giving only height and width. For these the TEI element <gi>dimensions</gi> should be used;
        this element must contain <emph>only</emph> the individual elements <gi>height</gi>, <gi>width</gi>
        and <gi>depth</gi> (or, for dimensions other than the three linear ones, <gi>dim</gi>, which may take an
        <att>type</att> such as "diameter", "arc", etc.).</p>
    
    <p>If normalization is desired, the <att>quantity</att> attribute on each dimension may be used to contain
        a mathematically actionable expression of the value (fraction expressed as decimal, or inches expressed
        as metric, for example). Approximate dimensions (often indicated "circa", "c." or "ca." in print) 
        should be tagged with the attribute <att>precision</att>="low". Dimensions that vary across the object
        (e.g. a tapering column wider at the base than at the top), should be given
        <att>min</att> and <att>max</att> attributes, rather than <att>quantity</att>.
    </p>
    
    <p>If <att>precision</att> is used in combination with <att>min</att> and <att>max</att>,
        the low precision is understood to refer to both these values. For more complicated expressions,
        the <gi>precision</gi> element may be used to make different precision statements about each
        of these attributes.
