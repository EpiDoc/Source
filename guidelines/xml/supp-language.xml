    <head>Languages and scripts</head>
    <p>TEI/EpiDoc provides mechanisms for encoding languages and scripts (writing systems) as they relate to the contents of an EpiDoc file and to the text(s) described and transcribed therein. In doing so, we make use of Internet standards for the identification of these languages and scripts. This portion of the <title>Guidelines</title> addresses all relevant aspects.</p>

        <head>Indicating languages and scripts used in an EpiDoc file</head>
        <p>TEI and EpiDoc follow the best current practice outlined in the Network Working Group's <ref target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646">RFC 5646: <title>Tags for Identifying Languages</title></ref>, which establishes the norms for same on an Internet-wide basis. The RFC and supporting documents define a syntax for creating short strings of characters (<soCalled>language tags</soCalled>) that function as unique identifiers for any desired combination of language and script. These tags are composed of <soCalled>subtags</soCalled> for language qua language, writing sysem (script), and regional and dialectical variation. The RFC also establishes a process for registration and maintenance of these subtags by the <ref target="https://www.iana.org/">Internet Assigned Numbers Authority</ref>.</p>
        <p>A valid EpiDoc file must make use of subtags recorded in the <ref target="https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry">IANA Language Subtag Registry</ref>. Many EpiDoc creators will already be familiar with some of these codes from other digital projects, for example:</p>
        <list type="bulleted">
            <item>Grek = Greek script</item>
            <item>Latn = Latin script</item>
            <item>en = English language (assumed to be in its standard script: Latn)</item>
            <item>fr = French language (assumed to be in its standard script: Latn)</item>
            <item>el = Modern Greek language (1453-; assumed to be in its standard script: Grek)</item>
            <item>grc = Ancient Greek language (to 1453; assumed to be in its standard script: Grek)</item>
            <item>grc-Latn = Ancient Greek Language (to 1453), rendered in Latin script</item>
        </list>
        <p>When the IANA registry does not provide appropriate codes, then an EpiDoc project may devise "private use subtags", so long as they are internally defined in the EpiDoc file as outlined in the following paragraph and so long as they conform syntactically to the specifications laid out in RFC 5646, sections <ref target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646#section-2.1">2.1: Syntax</ref> and <ref target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646#section-4.6">4.6: Considerations for Private Use Subtags</ref>. For example, the Campā Inscriptions team determined that the two Cham language subtags (cja = Western Cham and cjm = Eastern Cham) and the associated script subtag (Cham) were substantively different from the ancient Cham language and script represented in the inscriptions. Therefore the private use subtag "x-oldcam-latn-ci" was invented and given the project-specific meaning "Old Cam language in Old Cam script transliterated in Latin characters." Whenever possible, EpiDoc projects and practitioners should undertake to register new subtags with the IANA for the benefit of others. A procedure for same is set out in RFC 5646 <ref target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646#section-3.5">Section 3.5</ref>.</p>

        Note that the languages included here should only refer to the languages or writing systems contained within the text itself, rather than those throughout the edition.
        If the script differs from the default script of the language (e.g., Greek transliterated into Latin), this should also be indicated using the appropriate language codes, where available.</p>

        <head>Marking transitions in language and/or script in the text</head>
        <p>A single language should be indicated as the default for a text by including it in the <att>mainLang</att> attribute on the <gi>textLang</gi> element. The default script for a given language is assumed unless otherwise indicated (i.e. Greek will be written in the Greek alphabet, etc.). When transitions can between languages and/or script are limited in scope (i.e. a single word, a short phrase, etc. in a language differing from that declare in the <att>mainLang</att> attribute in the header), the word or words should be contained within a <gi>foreign</gi> element (see <ref target="trans-foreigntext.xml">Multi-Language Texts</ref>). Language and/or script may be identified by including the attribute <att>xml:lang</att>. In the following brief example from the US Epigraphy Project, the inscription begins in Latin but transitions to Greek which is written in the Latin script:</p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="https://usepigraphy.brown.edu/projects/usep/inscription/NY.NY.MMA.LG.18.145.5/">
            <div type="edition">
                <ab>
                    <lb n="1"/>Cum tu<unclear>i</unclear>s <foreign xml:lang="grc-Latn">pie zeses</foreign>.
                </ab> 
            </div>
        </egXML>
        <p>If longer passages of the text are in different languages and/or scripts, the default language may be further specified with an <att>xml:lang</att> attribute on the <tag>div type="edition"</tag> and if other sections are in different languages/scripts, these should be declared by adding a <att>xml:lang</att> attribute to the block-level containers of that text (e.g. <gi>ab</gi>, <gi>lg</gi>, <gi>seg</gi>, or <tag>div type="textpart"</tag>.
            (Compare the examples given at <ref target="trans-foreigntext.xml">Multi-Language Texts</ref> under point 2.) One may also indicate shifts in script in the same fashion; that is, a hypothetical inscription that is entirely in Greek but also includes Greek transliterated into the Roman alphabet would declare its default language ("grc") in the <att>xml:lang</att> attribute and transliterated passages would be marked with the <att>xml:lang</att> attribute with a value of "grc-Latn".
            It may also be desirable to indicate a change in hand when the script and/or language changes using the <gi>handShift</gi> element, if such a shift is discernible; further details about the script can be included in the <gi>handNote</gi> elements of the manuscript description.
            Compare the following example from the US Epigraphy Project, which begins in Latin and then contains a translation of the text in Greek:
