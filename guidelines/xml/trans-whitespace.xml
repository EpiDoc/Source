    <head>Managing Whitespace in Transcriptions</head>

    <p>In diplomatic and edited transcriptions, default Epidoc whitespace handling may not always
        produce expected results. Problems arise in several situations, the most common of which is
        spaces that appear before or after a phrase-level element. XML treats whitespace differently
        when it occurs inside an element that is defined to contain only subelements and no free
        text, and elements whose definition allows a mixture of text and other elements. In the
        first case, whitespace around the contained elements will be ignored. In the second case,
        spaces and returns will be treated as actual text, and will appear in formatted output as a
        single space. This is complicated by the way that editors such as oXygen XML handle wrapping
        of lines - lines that are wrapped for readability do not have space or linefeed characters
        separating them, they just appear to.</p>

    <p>In the example below, <gi>expan</gi> may have subelements <gi>abbr</gi> and <gi>ex</gi>
        as well as free text. In this case, spaces before or after the subelements
        will result in spaces appearing in the output. </p>

    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <expan><abbr>Aug</abbr><ex>ustus</ex></expan>
    </egXML>

    <p>If spaces appear in formatted Epidoc output where they don't belong, the first thing to do is
        to check the XML source files for spaces or linefeeds have been inserted during the encoding
        process, often for readability.</p>

    <p>In some cases, for example when encoding inscriptions in Hebrew or Arabic that use a
        right-to-left writing system, it is necessary to use line feeds before tags, in order to
        preserve directionality. When preserving whitespace exactly as it is entered is important,
        you must set the <tag>xsl:preserve-space</tag> property at the beginning of your xsl
        transformation file and identify the elements to which this applies. Then, you can manage
        the whitespace explicitly during the formatting process.</p>
