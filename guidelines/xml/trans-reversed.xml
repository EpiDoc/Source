    <p>Letters that are reversed (e.g. right-to-left) or inverted (rotated) with respect to the alignment
    of the surrounding text. These characters are considered to be set apart from the main body of text
    by their changed orientation, and so are marked with the <gi>hi</gi> tag. This element should not
    be used to indicate text that is all written in reverse, or boustrophedon documents (for which see
