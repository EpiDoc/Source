    <p>One way of extracting this terminology is through the vocabulary, using the @lemma attribute of the <gi>w</gi> element.</p>
    
    <p>Another way could be using the <gi>rs</gi> element and the different values of the @type attribute could be similar to the categories 
        used by the <ref target="http://edh-www.adw.uni-heidelberg.de/inschrift/erweiterteSuche">EDH</ref>. A @key or a @ref attribute could point to an authoriry list.</p>
