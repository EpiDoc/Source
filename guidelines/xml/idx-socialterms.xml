    <head>Military, religious, socio-economic terminology</head>
    <p>Military terminology, titulature, religious indicators, social/political/economic vocabulary,
        all terms in <term target="#EDH">EDH</term>, are not often tagged in EpiDoc projects, although
        they can be useful if <term target="#crosswalk">crosswalking</term> to
        <term target="#eagle">EAGLE</term> is desired.</p>

            <specDesc key="w"/>
            <specDesc key="rs"/>
        </specList>
    </p>
    
    <p>One way of extracting this terminology is through the vocabulary, using the <att>lemma</att> attribute of the
        <gi>w</gi> element (see explanation under <ref target="idx-titlesoffices.html">Titles and Offices</ref>).</p>
    
    <p>Another way could be using the <gi>rs</gi> element and the different values of the <att>type</att> attribute
        could be similar to the categories used by the <term target="#EDH">EDH</term>.
        A <att>key</att> or a <att>ref</att> attribute could point to an authority list 
        (see <ref target="idx-nontei.html">External Authorities (non-TEI)</ref>).</p>
