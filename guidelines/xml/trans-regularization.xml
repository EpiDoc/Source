    <head>Regularization</head>
    <p>Regularized spellings of irregular forms, such as dialect forms, late spellings, 
        phonetic spellings, etc.</p>

            <specDesc key="choice"/>

    <p>If your project makes a distinction between text corrected as a result of scribal
        error (i.e. <ref target="trans-erroneoussubstitution.html">Correction of Erroneous 
            Characters</ref>) and text normalized or regularized from a dialect or phonetic
    spelling, grammatical form, etc., perhaps because of the consideration that the latter is not
    strictly speaking <emph>wrong</emph>, then these normalizations can be tagged
    with <gi>orig</gi> (the original, scribal form) and <gi>reg</gi> (the regularized form). As with
        <gi>sic</gi> and <gi>corr</gi>, these will be grouped in a <gi>choice</gi> element,
    indicating that they are two editorial versions of the same span of text, and should
    be read as alternatives, not shown side by side.</p>
    
    <p>It is most common to mark a regularization of this kind at the level of the whole
    word, rather than of individual characters affected, as in the DDbDP and IOSPE
    examples given below. This will make it easier to generate an apparatus reading for
    the regularized form (or the original form, depending on which you want to privilege),
    but it may also be impossible to identify individual affected characters in a dialect
    spelling or grammatical form. On the other hand, tagging the individial characters
    might make it easier to index or search for specific features, such as the iotacism of ι and ει
    in the final example below.</p>

    <p>As shown in this last example, the in-word regularization does not currently display anything
        in any <code>$leiden-style</code>, because there is no Leiden siglum for "regularized spellings";
        editorial practice is usually to print irregular spellings uncorrected, or sometimes to treat them as
        errors (and therefore display as in <ref target="trans-erroneoussubstitution.html">Erroneous Substitution</ref>).
        Customization of the stylesheets will therefore be required to use regularization in a different way
        from DDbDP or IOSPE.
