    <p>EpiDoc follows TEI practice in marking line breaks on the support (as opposed to verse lines) using the <gi>lb</gi>,
        though the expansion "line-begins" is in many ways a more useful way of thinking about this element.  <gi>lb</gi> is an empty element
        to mark the point at which the line breaks (or begins).</p>

    <p>Because there is no containing element encapsulating lines, any information about the numbering, rendition, or condition
        of an entire line needs to be marked in an attribute on the preceding <gi>lb</gi>. For this reason, therefore, it is
        our convention to place an <gi>lb</gi> at the beginning of every epigraphic line in the edition, including the first.
        Any <att>rend</att> or numbering attributes on that <gi>lb</gi> refer to all text between the current and the following line-break.
        (See example below.)</p>
