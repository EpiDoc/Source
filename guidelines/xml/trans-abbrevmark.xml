    <head>Expansion of abbreviation including symbol/characters</head>
    <p>An abbreviation that includes a mark of some kind, such as an additional letter or mark of punctuation,
        that will not appear in the expanded form. This is often omitted in conventional editions, but may be
        useful to include in a digital transcription, for example for inclusion in a diplomatic rendering.</p>
    
    <p><specList>
            <specDesc key="expan"/>
            <specDesc key="ex"/>
            <specDesc key="am"/>
            <specDesc key="abbr"/>
            <specDesc key="g"/>
        </specList>
        <!--<listRef>
            <ptr target="a"/>
            </listRef>--></p>

    <p>Any characters or symbols that appear in the abbreviated form on the support (<gi>abbr</gi>), but do not form
    part of the fully expended word (<gi>expan</gi>), should be included within the <gi>abbr</gi> element, and should
    additionally be enclosed in an <gi>am</gi> (abbreviation mark) element. In the default XSLT transformation, for
    example, this will result in the content of the <gi>am</gi> being omitted from the interpretive transcription,
    but included in the diplomatic edition. (The first example below, therefore, would appear as "Aug(usti duo)" in
    interpretive, as "AVGG" in diplomatic.)</p>
