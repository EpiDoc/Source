    <head>Words and Lemmatization</head>
    <p>Tagging lexical words in the text and/or linking to lemmata for purposes of indexing or search.</p>
    <p>
        <specList>
            <specDesc key="w"/>
        </specList>
    </p>
    <p>Explicit markup of words (tokenization) and identification of their dictionary headwords (lemmatization)
        are both optional. Many projects simply leave these features unmarked, or rely on automated processes
        in search software to detect word-breaks and link to lemmatizing tools such as <term>Morpheus</term>.
        (The Papyrological Navigator, Perseus, and the TLG all use methods similar to this.)</p>
    
    <p>To explicitly mark-up lexical words in a papyrological or epigraphic text, however, each word in the text
        should be enclosed in a <gi>w</gi> element. (For ease of processing, it is advised that inter-word spacing,
        punctuation and other features be left outside of this element, and if possible there should be no spaces
        or carriage returns within the <gi>w</gi> element.)</p>
    
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" corresp="http://inslib.kcl.ac.uk/irt2009/IRT022.html">
        <w>maximo</w> <w>tribunicia</w> <w>potestate</w> <num>XXIIII</num> <w>imperatori</w>
    </egXML>
    
    <p>To record the lemma or dictionary headword of the word in question, the simplest solution is to enter
        the uninflected form in a <att>lemma</att> attribute, which may be used, for example, to generate the entries
        in a lexical index to the corpus.</p>
    
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <w lemma="ἵστημι">ἕστηκα</w>
    </egXML>
    
    <p>A slightly more sophisticated solution is to enter in a <att>lemmaRef</att>
        attribute a URL or other URI that points to the entry for the word in question in a database or online dictionary.
        This solution allows for better disambiguation of homonymous words, for example, or linking to morphological
        and statistical information about the word.</p>
    
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <w lemmaRef="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=fero&amp;la=la">tulisti</w>

    <div>
        <head>Multiple lemmata</head>
        <p>If a single word tag contains more than one indexable word (e.g. "populusque" in Latin or 
        "κἀκ" in Greek), or an incomplete word is ambiguous and might correspond to either of two or more lemmata
        (e.g. ΕΚΦΕΥΞ), then all lemmata that should be indexed may be included in the <att>lemma</att>
            attribute, separated by spaces:</p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <w lemma="suus que">suisque</w>
        </egXML>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <w lemma="καὶ ἐκ">κἀκ</w>
        </egXML>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
