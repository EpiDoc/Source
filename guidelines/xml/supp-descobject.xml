        <p>Although the TEI supplies a range of elements within <gi>supportDesc</gi> most EpiDoc
            projects to date have only found it necessary to make use of one of these:
                <gi>support</gi>. Within the <gi>support</gi> element, there are two different ways
            in which the relevant information may be structured.</p>

        <p>In the first approach, one produces one or more paragraphs of descriptive prose (wrapped
            in <gi>p</gi> elements as appropriate). Within this prose, certain classes of
            information are specially tagged, including the material out of which it is made, the
            type of object it is, and its dimensions (using the <gi>material</gi>,
                <gi>objectType</gi>, and <gi>dimensions</gi> elements). Reference to bibliography,
            as appropriate, may also be made in the standard way (i.e., <gi>bibl</gi>).</p>
        <p>In the second approach -- useful especially when data is being imported from or prepared
            for export to a database or other schema -- the specialized <gi>material</gi>,
                <gi>objectType</gi>, and <gi>dimensions</gi> elements are produced sequentially
            within <gi>support</gi> without any surrounding or connecting text. These may then be
            followed by one or more paragraphs of descriptive prose as desired.</p>
        <p>See also <ref target="supp-descdimensions.html">Dimensions</ref> for more information on
            tagging object, campus or letter dimensions.</p>
