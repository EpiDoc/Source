<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="trans-textpart" xml:lang="en">
    <head>Textpart</head>
    <p>Divisions of the edited text such as fragments, columns, chapters or versions in different languages.</p>
    <p>
        <specList>
            <specDesc key="div"/>
            <specDesc key="milestone"/>
        </specList>
    </p>

    <p>Units of the text that are separated and usually numbered independently by
        epigraphers and papyrologists—including fragments, columns, sections, chapters, independent texts on a single
        stone, marks, stamps, or graffiti grouped together—should be divided and
        numbered on the same basis in EpiDoc. The use of XML should not change the need for
        dividing and numbering the text in a way that makes semantic and intuitive sense to the editor.</p>
        
        <p>Each division containing a separate section of text should be wrapped in a
            separate <gi>ab</gi> inside a <gi>div</gi> with an <att>type</att>="textpart". It is often useful
            (although not obligatory) also to provide a <att>subtype</att> attribute naming the kind of subdivision
            of text being recorded here; <att>subtype</att> is not constrained, but common values might include
            "fragment", "column", "section", etc.</p>

    <p>These units may, of course, nest in almost any combination. If there are non-hierarchical
        overlaps between units (e.g. sections and columns) then one unit has to be selected as the
        "top level" division, and the other broken up between the larger division. These smaller,
        broken divisions may be connected using the <att>n</att> attribute or a <gi>link</gi>
        element.</p>

    <p>Where a unit within a single, continuous text need to be marked (for example, multiple blocks
        in a long relief text) the <gi>milestone</gi> element should be used instead to mark the
        point at which a break in the support occurs.</p>
