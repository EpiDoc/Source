    <p>A <gi>space</gi> should be used wherever there is an intentional space left on the support:
        i.e. a space that never contained text (vacat). A <att>unit</att> attribute should record
        the units of measurement in whatever form the editor requires (common values include
        "metre", "cm"), and a <att>quantity</att> attribute should record the number of such units
        measured.</p>
    <p>A <att>type</att> attribute may be used in order to indicate the reason for the
        empty space; possible values may include hole, damage, decoration, indent, etc. For instance, if a hole existed in the support prior to the addition of the text,
    this would best be represented with the value "hole;" however, this value would be less applicable if the hole was made after the the addition of text. Similarly, if intentional space was left
    to avoid existing damage on the support, a <att>type</att> attribute with value "damage" should be used, but not if the support was damaged after text was added; in the latter instance, if text was affected, <gi>gap</gi> should be used instead.</p>
