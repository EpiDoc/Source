 <div><p>It is customary in producing an edition of a pre-modern manuscript, papyrus, inscription, or other text-bearing
        object to enumerate the occasions on which modern persons encountered and reported seminal information about the
        object, its condition and disposition, etc., together with associated bibliographic references where possible.
        The initial such observation is often the occasion of finding, sometimes in situ, sometimes in circumstances or
        reuse, sometimes already in the context of a modern collection. There follow other observations, culminating in
        the "last observed location" or "current location."</p>
 
    <p>Following general TEI guidance, EpiDoc treats each such observation as a discrete event in space and time, and
        encodes each in a separate <gi>provenance</gi> element in the <gi>history</gi> section of the header. The
            <att>type</att> attribute is used with the following standard values to distinguish the major types of
        events:</p>
    <list rend="spacious">
        <item><tag>provenance type="found"</tag> is used to encode information about the initial modern observation of a
            text-bearing object</item>
        <item><tag>provenance type="observed"</tag> is used to encode information about subsequent modern
            observations</item>
        <item><tag>provenance type="autopsy"</tag> is a special case of <tag>provenance type="observed"</tag> that is
            used to encode a modern observation event during which the editor (i.e., the person creating the present
            edition) personally examined the object</item>
    </list>
    <p>A general example is provided in the main section on <ref target="supp-history.html">Provence of the text-bearing object</ref>. Specific guidance for
        each type of provenance event is provided in its own section as follows:</p>
    <list>
        <item><ref target="supp-histfound.html">Discovery (finding, findspot)</ref></item>
        <item><ref target="supp-histmodern.html">Observation and autopsy, including "current/last location"</ref></item>
    </list>
