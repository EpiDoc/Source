        <p> Description of the text field(s) or campus of an inscription or text may include
            features such as the shape and dimensions of the text area, its placement on one or more
            face or in columns, direction and orientation of text (although cf. <ref
                target="trans-linebreakdirection.html">Direction of Text</ref>), the presence of
            margins, mouldings, or guide-lines, the relationship of each text to any decoration or
            other physical feature of the object (a text laid out in the four corners of a cross,
            for example) or the relationship of multiple texts to one another. </p>

        <p> For the sake of compatibility with the <ref>EAGLE</ref> databases, some projects have
            tagged the form of execution of the text (incised, scratched, stamped, etc.) with an
                <gi>rs</gi> with <att>type</att> of "execution". (See further the <ref

                >authority list: Sciptura</ref> [Google Spreadsheet] for suggested typology.) </p>
