    <p>A <gi>milestone</gi> is used to describe the support, rather than the structure, of the text.
        It can be used to mark a point in the text at which the support changes in some respect, for
        instance where a text is inscribed across a series of blocks and the editor wants to show
        the point at which one block ends and another begins. This can be represented by giving the
            <gi>milestone</gi> element a <att>unit</att> value of "block". Each
            <gi>milestone</gi> can also be given an <att>n</att> to allow the blocks (or
        whatever non-structural textpart is being described) to be numbered.</p>
