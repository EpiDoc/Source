    <head>Original date of text and/or object</head>
    <p>The date of origin of the text (or in some cases, of the object or some other feature, decoration, or reuse of it),
    whether the result of the editor's analysis or an explicit, internal date. May also record possible ranges of dates,
    degrees of precision and dating criteria.</p>
    
    <p><specList>
        <specDesc key="origDate"/>
        <specDesc key="precision"/>
    </specList></p>
    
    <p>
        The date of orgin of the text (or object, if different) should be recorded in an <gi>origDate</gi> element
        in the <gi>origin</gi> section of the manuscript description area. If different dates need to be recorded
        for text and object, different texts on the same support, or different interventions in the same text, the
        <gi>origDate</gi> may be repeated, or the entire <gi>history</gi> may be embedded in multiple
        <gi>msPart</gi>s.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It is generally recommended to encode the dating information in numerical form, following the 
        proleptic Julian calendar, using the att.datable.custom attributes on the <gi>origDate</gi> element.
        (Because the default dating system assumed by the TEI is the Gregorian calendar, the dating element
        should always carry a <att>datingMethod</att> attribute pointing to a <gi>calendar</gi> element in the
        header--or to an external authority for the Julian calendar, such as
        <ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar</ref>.)
    </p>
    
    <p>
        A specific date, whether a single day, month, or year in the Julian calendar, can be expressed using
        the <att>when-custom</att> attribute, which should be laid out in the same form as a W3 date (albeit
        in the Julian, not Gregorian calendar). In other words:
        <list type="ordered">
            <item>A year should be encoded in four digits, with leading zeroes as necessary (i.e. 14 C.E. should be "0014")</item>
            <item>B.C.E./B.C. dates should be recorded as negative numbers (i.e. preceded by "-"); NB there is no year "0"</item>
            <item>Month and day should be encoded in two digits, with leading zero as necessary (i.e. January 7th should be "--01-07")</item>
            <item>A year may appear without months or day; a year+month may appear without day</item>
        </list>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        A date within a range (such as the reign of an emperor, or a century for e.g. palaeographically dated text)
        should be encoded using the <att>notBefore-custom</att> and <att>notAfter-custom</att> attributes, marking the beginning
        and end of the possible span of dates. The date formats of these attributes are the same as for
        <gi>when-custom</gi>.
    </p>

        <head>Certainty and precision</head>
        <p>
            Not all texts are dated confidently to a specific year or firm span of years. If a date given is flagged
            explicitly as less certain than usual (for example, either with a "?" or a formulation such as "just possibly")
            the <gi>origDate</gi> may be given a <att>cert</att> attribute with a value of "low". If a date is flagged
            as approximate (which is different from being uncertain; often written "circa", "ca." or "c.") <gi>origDate</gi>
            should be given an <att>precision</att> with a value of low. If a date range is specified (with
            <att>notBefore-custom</att> and <att>notAfter-custom</att>) whose start and end points are essentially
            arbitrary, such as a century or half-century for a palaeographical date, then a <att>precision</att> of 
            "medium" should be given, to indicate that the start and end-points are both notional. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In a few cases, a text may be dated within a span of dates with a notional end-point but a firm
            <foreign xml:lang="la">terminus post quem</foreign>. To record this in XML, a <gi>precision</gi>
            element may be placed inside the <gi>origDate</gi> to point to whichever of the attributes represents
            the less concrete end-point. (See third example below.)
