    <p>Editor marks space left uninscribed on the support, but expresses doubt as to whether

    <p>A <gi>space</gi> should be used wherever there is an intentional space left on the
        support: i.e. a space that never contained text (vacat). To express uncertainty as to whether or not
        a vacat is actually present (as opposed to text erased or lost, say),
        a <gi>certainty</gi> element with a <att>match</att>
        corresponding to the parent element (i.e. the <gi>gap</gi> element) should be given a
        <att>locus</att> with a value of "name" (meaning the <gi>space</gi> element may not be correct).</p>
