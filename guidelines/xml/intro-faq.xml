                <item>If you want someone who can help you with the technical work of setting up a project, it is
                    essential that you budget this work in your project funding applications from a very early stage.
                    You would advised to consult with possible collaborators in the planning stages, as estimating
                    the time and financial cost of setting up an XML project is likely to be an involved process.</item>
