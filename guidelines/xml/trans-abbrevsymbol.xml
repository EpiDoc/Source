    <head>Expansion of symbol</head>
    <p>A word expanded, not from an abbreviation or suspension of letters in the text, but from a symbol
    or glyph on the stone/page. The symbol may or may not be recorded in the markup.</p>
    <p>
        <specList>
            <specDesc key="abbr"/>
            <specDesc key="am"/>
            <specDesc key="expan"/>
            <specDesc key="ex"/>
            <specDesc key="g"/>
        </specList>
    </p> 
    
    <p>When an entire word is resolved by the editor on the basis not of an abbreviation per se, but of a symbolic mark
    or ideogram, such as the denarius symbol, the glyph for year or half, the solidus for a synonymous patronymic or
    freedman, Tyrolean 'et', and such symbols, a traditional edition generally does not represent the symbol itself, only
    showing the expanded word in parentheses. In the simplest case, EpiDoc can simply replicate this practice, using
    <gi>expan</gi> and <gi>ex</gi> to encode the expanded word without any <gi>abbr</gi> recorded.</p>
    
    <p>It is preferable however, where possible, to encode fully the characters on the stone as well as the editor's
    interpretation of them. In this case the <gi>abbr</gi> element will be used, with the addition of an <gi>am</gi>
    (abbreviation mark), to indicate that the symbol, while part of the abbreviation, is not part of the resolved
    word. </p>
