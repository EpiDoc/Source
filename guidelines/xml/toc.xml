    <head>EpiDoc Guidelines: Ancient documents in TEI XML</head>

    <p>EpiDoc is an international, collaborative effort that provides guidelines and tools for encoding scholarly and
        educational editions of ancient documents. These are the <title>Guidelines</title> produced by the
        collaborative. In addition, the <ref target="http://epidoc.sf.net">EpiDoc Website</ref> provides access to all
        the tools and collaboration environments supported by the collaborative.</p>

    <p>EpiDoc uses a subset of the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index-toc.html">Text
            Encoding Initiative's (TEI) standard</ref> for the representation of texts in digital form using the <ref
            target="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">Extensible Markup Language (XML)</ref>, a technical standard
        promulgated by the World-Wide Web Consortium. It addresses not only the transcription and editorial preparation
        of the texts themselves, but also the the history and materiality of the objects on which the texts appear.</p>

    <p>These <title>Guidelines</title> contain descriptions of the textual, descriptive, and other features that are
        often expressed with EpiDoc, as well as the TEI elements and attributes that are used to encode them. The links
        below provide a number of entry points into the full document and should be thought of more as a series of
        thematic indexes into the content of the <title>Guidelines</title>, rather than a single "Table of Contents" that reflects an
        ordered, hierarchical document structure.</p>
