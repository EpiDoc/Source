        <p>The Encoding Guidelines themselves contain descriptions of the textual, descriptive and other
        features that are often recorded in Epidoc, and the elements and attributes that are used to 
        encode them.
        They are divided into three sections: 
        encoding descriptive and other information about the document and text-bearing object;
        encoding transcriptions of epigraphic and other texts;
        and encoding the vocabularies and other data used for indexing, searching and concording the editions. 
        Within each major section, elements and their attributes are organized thematically, but there are
        potentially more useful entry-points into this information from the communities of practice indices.</p>
    <p>In order to make it easier for different disciplinary groups or communities of practice to use the
        Epidoc Guidelines, this section provides targetted approaches. These provide customized strategies
        and overall structures, as well as specific mappings from known conventions to EpiDoc features.</p>
