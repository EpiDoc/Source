<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="trans-parallelcopy" xml:lang="en">
    <head>Parallel Text</head>
    <p>Text restored from parallel copy</p>

            <specDesc key="supplied"/>

    </p>

    <p>Where text is restored by the editor from a parallel copy (e.g. a papyrus with the same literary text, or an 
        inscription with a more complete version of a decree or imperial letter), this should be indicated with
        a <gi>supplied</gi> element, indicating the parallel source by <att>evidence</att> with a value of
        "parallel".</p>
    <p>In most epigraphic/papyrological styles this text will be displayed with underline only (similarly to 
        <ref target="trans-previouseditor.html">Previous Editor</ref>), but in the Duke Databank the text
        may also be enclosed in square brackets to indicate the fact that  the text is now completely lost (as 
        opposed to merely unclear, corrupt or uncertain).
        <!-- add explanation of different handling in DCLP -->
    </p>

        <quote>a&#818;b&#818;c&#818; or [a&#818;b&#818;c&#818;]</quote>
        <bibl corresp="#ddbdp"/>
    </cit>

    <p>The first example demonstrates that, when the reason for the parallel supplementation is "undefined", the
    Duke Databank follows the general pattern.</p>
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="panciera london ddbdp" corresp="#panciera">
        <supplied evidence="parallel" reason="undefined">abc</supplied>
    </egXML>
    
    <p>The second example illustrates the different in approach between the Duke Databank and other styles
    when the reason for supplementation is complete loss.</p>

    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="panciera london ddbdp" corresp="#ddbdp">
        <supplied evidence="parallel" reason="lost">abc</supplied>
    </egXML>
    
    <p>A more complex example illustrates the expressiveness of the Duke Databank approach when 
    dealing with a lacunose and damaged text.</p>
