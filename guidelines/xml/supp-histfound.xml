    <head>Findspot and find context</head>
    <p>All matters related to the provenance of a document are encoded in the Manuscript Description (<gi>msDesc</gi>)
        portion of the TEI header. In particular, they are placed within the <gi>history</gi> subsection (see further
        <ref target="supp-history.html">Dates and locations of modern observations</ref>).</p>

    <p>Standard EpiDoc files include all relevant spatial, temporal, and circumstantial information about the initial
        discovery of a text-bearing object in a <gi>provenance</gi> tag with a <att>type</att> attribute bearing the
        value "found". Generally, there will only be one such element, unless separate fragments of the document were
        found in different locations. Recommended, optional values for <att>subtype</att> are available if there is a need to make computationally actionable distinctions between different circumstances of finding (see list in <ref target="supp-histlocations.html">Dates and locations of modern observations</ref>).</p>
     <p>The information within each <gi>provenance</gi> element can take the form of one
        or more paragraphs of prose, or of a list (with appropriate TEI tags used as necessary). Sometimes circumstances
        and editorial approach will dictate that the contents of <gi>provenance</gi> element be largely prose; other
        times a more data-oriented encoding approach may be indicated. In either case, best practice is to tag place
        names, personal names and other information worthy of indexing, linking or querying appropriately (e.g., with
            <gi>persName</gi>, <gi>placeName</gi>, etc.).</p>

<!-- NB: DO NOT REFORMAT THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLES: WHITESPACE MATTERS HERE! -->
     
<p>Here is an example adapted from a milestone published in <ref target="http://inslib.kcl.ac.uk/irt2009/index.html">The Inscriptions of Roman Tripolitania</ref>:</p>
     
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve"><provenance type="found">
 <placeName key="db648">Coast Road: Oea-Lepcis Magna</placeName>: 
 <rs type="monuList" key="db669">Gasr Garabulli</rs>: in the Concessione Gherardi, 1 km. West of 
 the village.
</provenance>
</egXML>
        
<p>And another adapted from an ostracon published in <ref target="http://papyri.info">Papyri.info</ref>:</p>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve"><provenance type="found">
 Roman dump at <placeName ref="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/785986">Berenike</placeName>.
</provenance>
</egXML>
        
<p>And a third from the <ref target="http://isaw.nyu.edu/publications/inscriptions/campa/">Corpus of the Inscriptions of Cāmpa</ref> project, 
demonstrating the use of standard TEI date attributes to indicate the timing of the discovery:</p>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:space="preserve"><provenance type="found" notAfter="1999">
 <ab>It seems that this piece was part of the private collection of Mr. Vũ Kim Lộc in Hồ Chí 
 Minh City at least until 1999, when Anne-Valérie Schweyer published a study of other objects 
 in the same collection (<ref target="C0205.xml">C. 205</ref>, 
 <ref target="C0206.xml">C. 206</ref>, <ref target="C0207.xml">C. 207</ref>) although without 
 mentioning the present item and <ref target="C0209.xml">C. 209</ref>.</ab>

        <head>Linking place of origin to place of finding</head>
        <p>It is often desirable, when objects are thought to have been found in situ, to indicate the
        relationship between place of finding and place of origin. Guidance and examples are provided 
        in the section on <ref target="supp-historigin.html">Original location of the text-bearing object</ref>.</p>
