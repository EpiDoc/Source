    <p>Text added by ancient hand (above, below, left etc.)</p>
    <p>In traditional Leiden the place of added text is not specified in the transcription, but
        noted in the apparatus or commentary. This added information, recorded here by use of the
        place attribute, is therefore optional and may be omitted without harm. If it is to be
        included in the transcription, <gi>add</gi> should be used, with a
            <att>place</att> whose value should reflect the position of the added text
        ("above", "below", "left" etc.).</p>
