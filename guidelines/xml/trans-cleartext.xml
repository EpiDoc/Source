    <p>Text which is completely legible and requires no editorial intervention should be passed through the
        transformation with no modification or enhancement.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The only special feature worth highlighting is that <emph>the presence or absence of</emph> whitespace in the XML
        will be preserved in any output (HTML, ODF, etc.), so spaces of any kind (including tabs, new lines, etc.) should only
        be placed between words. To preserve this behaviour, it is recommended that the <gi>div</gi> containing the
        transcribed text should be given the attribute <att>xml:space</att> with a value of "preserve".
