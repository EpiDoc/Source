    <p>Most of the features that most commonly occur in an epigraphic/papyrological edition are catered for
        by specific locations in an EpiDoc file. This document aims to give an overview of those locations.
        Individual pages in the <ref target="app-allsupp.html">Supporting Data</ref> section of the Guidelines
        will give more detailed information on each of these elements and features.</p>
