    <head>Structure of an EpiDoc edition</head>
    <p>This section introduces the structure and shape of an EpiDoc edition, 
        introducing the TEI P5 approach to manuscript description and history,
        the divisions in the body, etc.</p>

    <p>Most of the features that most commonly occur in an epigraphic/papyrological edition are catered for
        by specific locations in an EpiDoc file. This document aims to give an overview of those locations.
        Individual pages in the <ref target="app-allsupp.html">Supporting Data</ref> section of the Guidelines
        will give more detailed information on each of these elements and features.</p>
    
    <p>A relatively simple EpiDoc file containing descriptive and historical information about an inscription might look
        something like the following example. A version of this example, keyed to the latest version of the EpiDoc
        schema and suitable for use as a project template, may be downloaded from the EpiDoc website: <ref
