    <p>When a single lacuna in the transcribed edition is represented by a combination of restored text,
        (<gi>supplied</gi>) and lost sections (<gi>gap</gi>), these need to be encoded as distinct entities in
        EpiDoc, although they are perceived as part of a single lacuna in the Leiden representation. The 
        <term target="#epidoc-stylesheets">EpiDoc Example XSLT</term> includes a template which will ensure
        extra square brackets are not printed between the two parts of the lacuna (i.e. "[abc ...]" not "[abc] [...]").
