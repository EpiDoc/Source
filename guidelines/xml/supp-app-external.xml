    <head>External apparatus criticus</head>
    <p>An external division of the edition in which all apparatus criticus features and notes are explicitly tagged.</p>
    <!-- can have div's or p's  here. Divs are for subsections. -->
    <p><specList>
        <specDesc key="listApp"/>
        <specDesc key="app"/>

    </specList></p>
     
    <p>The simplest entry in an epigraphic or papyrological apparatus criticus is a general comment on 
    the text as a whole, with no specific line reference or textual feature described. (Like all external apparatus
    features described in this page, this example should appear in the <tag>div type="apparatus"</tag>, and
    perhaps be grouped together in a <gi>listApp</gi>.)
    </p>
     
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <div type="apparatus">
        <listApp>
            <app><note>The face is very weathered, all readings are uncertain.</note></app>
        </listApp>
    </div>
    </egXML> 
    
    <p>The second example is of a simple comment, but tied to a particular line or text fragment 
        (using in this case the attribute <att>loc</att>, which contains a human-readable or "canonical"
        citation for the line referenced):</p>
    
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <app loc="a 7">
            <note>The erasure in this line is ineffective but indubitably deliberate.</note>
        </app>
    </egXML>
    
    <p>Alternative restorations, perhaps recording the opinion of previous editors or attributing
        current readings to them, may also be tagged explicitly in the external apparatus division:
    </p>
    
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <app loc="i 3">
            <lem>καθο<supplied reason="lost">σίωσις</supplied></lem>
            <rdg source="#tdb1971">καθ<supplied reason="lost">όλου</supplied></rdg>
        </app>
    </egXML>
    
    <p>An <gi>app</gi> element in the external apparatus may also point directly to a feature
    tagged within the text transcription division, in order to comment upon it, or simply to display
    the marked-up feature without duplicating the markup. (Similar to the practice of
    <ref target="supp-app-inline.html">inline apparatus</ref> discussed elsewhere.)
    </p>
    
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <choice xml:id="choice3">
            <corr>σύμπαντα</corr>
            <sic>σινπαταν</sic>
        </choice>
        <!-- ... -->
        <app loc="12" from="#choice3">
            <note>so Mommsen, without comment.</note>
        </app>
    </egXML>
    
    <p>Variant readings may also arise not from a disagreement among editors, but from genuine
    ambiguity in reading. An unclear letter with several possible interpretations might appear in the
    apparatus (or in the text itself) as:</p>
    
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <choice xml:id="choice4">
            <unclear>τ</unclear> 
            <unclear>γ</unclear>
            <unclear>ε</unclear>
            <unclear>ζ</unclear>
            <unclear>ξ</unclear>
            <unclear>π</unclear>
            <unclear>σ</unclear>
        </choice>
        <!-- ... -->
        <app loc="4" from="#choice4">
            <note>What survives of the last letter before the break is consonant with Τ, Γ, Ε, Ζ, Ξ, Π, Σ</note>
        </app>
    </egXML>
