    <p><!--More prose explanation--></p>

    <p>As each line in an EpiDoc encoded inscription begins with an <gi>lb</gi>, attributes on this
        element can be understood to refer to the content of that line, i.e. all text before the
        following <gi>lb</gi> (see also <ref target="trans-linebreak.html">Line Breaks</ref>).</p>

    <p>In the case of most inscriptions, left-to-right aligned text does not need to be flagged, as
        it is the default direction. One might need to use <att>rend</att> in the case of boustrophedon text, for instance.</p>

    <p>Other values of <att>rend</att> can be created in the case of texts written vertically, in
        a circle or spiral, or otherwise unusually.</p>
