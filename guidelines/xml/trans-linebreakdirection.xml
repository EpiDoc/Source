    <head>Line Breaks: Direction of Text</head>
    <p rend="tag-defs">
        <specList>
                <specDesc key="lb"/>
            </specList>
    </p>
    <p>As each line in an EpiDoc encoded inscription begins with an <gi>lb</gi>, attributes on this
        element can be understood to refer to the content of that line, i.e. all text before the
        following <gi>lb</gi> (see also <ref target="trans-linebreak.html">Line Breaks</ref>).
    At present, therefore, EpiDoc recommends the use of the following values in the <att>rend</att>
    attribute on the <gi>lb</gi> immediately preceding the line of text in question:</p>
    
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <lb rend="left-to-right"/>
        <lb rend="right-to-left"/>
    </egXML>

    <p>In the case of most inscriptions, left-to-right aligned text does not need to be flagged, as
        it is the default direction. One might need to use <att>rend</att> in the case of boustrophedon text, for instance.</p>

    <p>Other values of <att>rend</att> can be created in the case of texts written vertically, in
        a circle or spiral, or otherwise unusually. (But these values are not currently handled by the Example Stylesheets.)</p>
    
    <!--<p>Note: as of 31 May 2013, the EpiDoc Example Stylesheets do not provide any support for the handling of these
        recommended values. There is a bug report (<ref target="https://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/bugs/118/">Ticket no.
            118</ref>) open against the stylesheets for this reason, which should be consulted for the current state of
        affairs. If this deficiency still obtained at the time this guidelines page was last generated, it is surely
        reflected in the rendering of the examples below.</p>-->
