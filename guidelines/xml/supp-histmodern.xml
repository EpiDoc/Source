    <p>All matters related to the provenance of a document are encoded in the Manuscript Description (<tag>msDesc</tag>) portion of the TEI header. In particular, they are placed within the <tag>history</tag> subsection.<note>See further: <list>

    <p>Within the <tag>history</tag> subsection, relevant information is grouped by "events" in the life of the document. Information related to documented, modern sightings (observations) of a document and the associated context is presented in one or more <tag>event type="observed"</tag> elements. This information within each <tag>event</tag> element can take the form of one or more paragraphs of prose, or of a list (with appropriate TEI tags used as necessary). As appropriate, place names, personal names and other information worthy of indexing, linking or querying should be tagged appropriately (e.g., with <tag>persName</tag>, <tag>placeName</tag>, etc.). Note the following examples.</p>
