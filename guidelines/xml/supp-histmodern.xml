    <p>When producing a scholarly edition of a pre-modern text, it is often essential to encode what is known about the
        modern history of observation and recording, as well as transactions involving the object. Ideally, this account begins with <ref target="supp-histfound.html"
            >the discovery of the text-bearing object (findspot)</ref>, details each substantive subsequent instance of
        reporting, and culminates in a report of the last-known or last-observed location. Such a history can provide
        important insight into the likely original location of the object. It places both published bibliography and
        unpublished archival materials (such as early travelers' notebooks) into a chronological sequence that is
        sometimes crucial to determining the origins of variant readings and supplements. The editor can use this
        history to signal her own moments of interaction with the text-bearing object and, in conjunction with <ref
            target="supp-histinvno.html">inventory and repository information encoded elsewhere in the edition</ref>,
        can equip the reader with the ability to locate, verify, and build upon the present edition.</p>


    <p>Just like the description of discovery and place of finding, TEI/EpiDoc uses a separate <gi>provenance</gi>
        element to record each subsequent instance of modern observation, including the final "last known location".
        Extended prose can be used, but it is best practice to markup the spatial and temporal components wherever
        possible in order to facilitate subsequent processing, search index creation, and the like.</p>
    
    <p>EpiDoc recognizes the following values for the <att>type</att> attribute on <gi>provenance</gi>:</p>
     <list rend="spacious">
         <item><tag>provenance type="found"</tag> is used to encode information about the first appearance, or key re-appearance, of the text-bearing object in modern times; see <ref target="supp-histfound.html">Findspot and find context</ref></item>
         <item><tag>provenance type="observed"</tag> is used to encode information about subsequent modern
             observations</item>
         <item><tag>provenance type="not-observed"</tag> is used to encode information about a specific, unsuccessful attempt to locate an object in a presumed or previously recorded location</item>
         <item><tag>provenance type="transferred"</tag> is used to encode information about documentable modern relocations of the text-bearing object</item>
     </list>
     <p>Recommended, optional values for <att>subtype</att> are available if there is a need to make computationally actionable distinctions between different circumstances of finding (see list in <ref target="supp-histlocations.html">Dates and locations of modern observations</ref>). NB: the old recommendation of <tag>provenance type="autopsy"</tag> as a special case of <tag>provenance type="observed"</tag> is now deprecated in favor of <tag>provenance type="observed" subtype="autopsied"</tag>.</p>
     <p>The following values are recommended for <att>subtype</att> when using <tag>provenance type="transferred"</tag>.</p>

     because Camille Paris himself, in the first ever report of the inscription, clearly states 
     that the stone was already broken in three pieces when he found it. For reasons unknown to 
     us, this report is not cited in any of the publications of Parmentier and Cœdès, and could 
     thus come to be forgotten by subsequent generations of scholars.</note></p>
