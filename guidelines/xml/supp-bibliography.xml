    <head>Encoding the Bibliography</head>
    <p>The bibliographical citations within an epigraphic/papyrological edition (to be distinguished

    <div>
        <head>Master bibliography</head>
        <p>It is generally recommended that a master bibliography, containing all works cited in a
            publication or project (whether including discussions or only previous publications of
            texts) be encoded in a separate, single file. This might validate to the EpiDoc schema
            or to a generic TEI bibliographic schema, or could even be a free-standing database, or
            a HTML page with an <att>id</att> for each bibliographical entry.</p>

        <p>If encoding in TEI, the bibliography should comprise a structured list either of
                <gi>bibl</gi> elements (recommended) or <gi>biblStruct</gi> elements (probably
            overkill for most projects, but see second example below). An <att>xml:id</att> on each
            item will allow referencing or linking from the localized bibliographic citations in
            individual texts.</p>

    <div>
        <head>Bibliographic citations</head>
        <p>Individual texts will often contain multiple bibliographic citations, for example to
            works cited in commentary, the source of translations or photographs, and most
            importantly, to previous publications of the same text by other scholars. Within an
            EpiDoc edition, such citations should be contained in the <tag>div
                type="bibliography"</tag>, either in an unstructured <gi>p</gi> (if the bibliography
            is a paragraph of free text with connecting prose such as, "First published in ..., from
            notebooks; reprinted in ...; whence ... . Later re-edited from autopsy by..." etc.) or
            in a <gi>listBibl</gi> if the citations are a simple (or numbered) list. </p>

        <p>Some projects prefer to create multiple <tag>div type="bibliography"</tag> sections for
            each text in order to group bibliographic citations thematically (e.g., prior editions,
            derivative editions, available illustrations, and the like. The <att>subtype</att> may
            be used to distinguish between them and to facilitate processing. In particular, lists
            of images published on-line or in print by third parties are sometimes encoded within
                <tag>div type="bibliography" subtype="illustrations"</tag>, regarding which see
            further <ref target="supp-images.html">Images, figures, and facsimile</ref>.</p>

        <p>Each bibliographic citation may be encoded relatively simply in a <gi>bibl</gi> element
            in the form that is desired in the online (or print) edition, be that a full
            bibliographic reference or abbreviated author + date or similar. It is often useful,
            however, to link back to the entry in a bibliographic authority (generally the master
            bibliography), for example so that: <list type="ordered">
                <item>edition can hyperlink back from short title to a full or even annotated
                    bibliography;</item>
                <item>bibliographic citations (full or short) can be automatically generated from
                    the main bibliography, providing more consistency and reducing the need for
                    multiple entry of identical information;</item>
                <item>a bibliographic concordance can be generated (using the <gi>idno</gi> of the
                    current edition, the <att>xml:id</att> of the bibliographic item, and the
                        <gi>citedRange</gi> of the bibliographic citation in the edition.</item>
            </list>
        </p>

        <p>Assuming a master bibliography in TEI containing the entries from the first example
            above, the bibliographic citation below would (a) point to the Reynolds 1971 title
            therein, and (b) state unambiguously that the text in whose edition this citation
            appears was previously published as number 3 in her edition.</p>

        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <bibl><ptr target="biblio.xml#jmr1971a"/>
                <citedRange>3</citedRange></bibl>
        </egXML>

        <p>This would allow, firstly, the edition to display text such as <q>Reynolds 1971, 3</q> or
                <q>Reynolds, 'Zawiet Msus' (1971), no. 3</q> or similar; and secondly a
            bibliographic concordance to be generated that lists all of the inscriptions in each
            previous publication, showing which inscription in the current collection corresponds to
            each. (See for example the <ref
                target="http://insaph.kcl.ac.uk/iaph2007/inscriptions/concordance/publication/jmr1980.html"
                >InsAph concordance</ref> for a Reynolds article.)</p>

        <p>The following example, adapted from the <ref target="http://iospe.kcl.ac.uk/index.html"
                >Ancient Inscriptions of the Northern Black Sea (IOSPE)</ref>, demonstrates the use
            of a single <tag>div type="bibliography"</tag> with two internal bibliographic lists of
            editions, one for each of two texts on the one support. Note the use of <gi>ptr</gi> to
            refer to bibliographic items in an external bibliographic list, as described above.</p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <div type="bibliography">

                </listBibl>

        <p>This example, adapted from the <ref
                target="http://isaw.nyu.edu/publications/inscriptions/campa/">Corpus of the
                Inscriptions of Campā</ref>, demonstrates the use of two, subtyped <tag>div
                type="bibliography"</tag> sections, one listing previous editions of the text and
            the other listing other secondary work on the text. It also demonstrates the use of a
            prose bibliographic description, rather than a simple list, in order to provide users
            with information about the relationship between cited editions.</p>
