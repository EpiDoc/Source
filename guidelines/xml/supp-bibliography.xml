    <div>
        <head>Master bibliography</head>
        <p>It is generally recommended that a master bibliography, containing all works cited in a
            publication or project (whether including discussions or only previous publications of
            texts) be encoded in a separate, single file. This might validate to the EpiDoc schema
            or to a generic TEI bibliographic schema, or could even be a free-standing database, or
            a HTML page with an <att>id</att> for each bibliographical entry.</p>

        <p>If encoding in TEI, the bibliography should comprise a structured list either of
                <gi>bibl</gi> elements (recommended) or <gi>biblStruct</gi> elements (probably
            overkill for most projects, but see second example below). An <att>xml:id</att> on each
            item will allow referencing or linking from the localized bibliographic citations in
            individual texts.</p>

        <head>Master bibliography in Zotero</head>
        <p>You may want to maintain your bibliography in a Zotero group library or into your
            personal Zotero library and use that for your EpiDoc project.</p>
        <p>You can export a master bibliography in TEI from Zotero to work following the guidelines
            above.</p>
        <p>You can also use directly the Zotero API to print your bibliography using the example Stylesheets.</p>
        <p>To do the latter you will need to</p>
        <list type="ordered">
            <item>Enter data correctly in Zotero</item>
            <item>Enter citations in your file (see below)</item>
            <item>Compile the bibliography and style the citations with the a <ref
                    target="http://citationstyles.org/">CLS Style</ref> (it is very wise to use the
                available ones, but you can still create your own)</item>
        </list>
        <p>To use this feature of the Example Stylesheets you will have to select a value for the
            parameter <emph>bibliography</emph>.</p>
        <list>
            <item>none: (default), applies any other locally specified templates and does neither of
                the following</item>
            <item>localTEI: the path to the TEI xml bibliography file needs to be given in the
                parameter localBibl, with a relative path from the xslt (default location, the
                parent directory of the xslt). This will look up for each bibl the value given in
                any ptr/@target and print author or editor and date from the TEI bibliography</item>
            <item>zotero: selecting this will use the example stylesheets to call the Zotero API.
                There are a series of other parameters which need to be set <list>
                    <item>parameter <emph>ZoteroUorG</emph> : which selects if the target library in
                        zotero is a group library (default) or a user library </item>
                    <item>parameter <emph>ZoteroKey</emph> : which gives the key to the library (for
                        the time being it defaults on the EAGLE group bibliography) </item>
                    <item>parameter <emph>ZoteroNS</emph> : specifies a namespace, if tags in the
                        Zotero library use any (default on nothing) </item>
                    <item>parameter <emph>ZoteroStyle</emph> : specifies the Zotero Style to be used
                        for the output (defaults on the chicago-author-date, as I think Zotero does
                        anyway)</item>

                </list>
            </item>
        </list>
        <p>The assumptions here are that you have an accessible and open library in Zotero, and
            that you have assigned a tag to each record you want to use, perhaps with a prefix, in
            case the same bibliography is used by several projects.</p>
        <p>Given the defaults above, if nothing but <emph>bibliography=zotero</emph> is specified,
            the transformation will then look into the EAGLE group library for items with tags equal
            to the ones given in each <gi>ptr</gi> with <att>target</att> of each <gi>bibl</gi> and
            will return <gi>bibl</gi> elements present in a <tag>div[@type='bibliography']</tag> as
            full citations, whereas it will print a formatted citation for the other <gi>bibl</gi>,
            wherever they occur. The tag assigned in Zotero MUST be uniquely assigned in the
            library.</p>
        <p>This is testable using the parameter <emph>edn-structure=eagle</emph> parameter.</p>
        <p>The following example, adapted from the Beta Maṣāḥǝft project, shows the encoding using
                <gi>bibl</gi> and a <gi>ptr</gi> with <att>target</att> equal to the Zotero tag, in
            two different contexts, the bibliography and a citation in the edition. The following
            explanation will clarify the settings and the output.</p>
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

        <p>The project uses a Group library in Zotero, so <emph>ZoteroUorG=group</emph> has been
            left to the default value, <emph>ZoteroKey</emph> has been set to the group key 358366
            of the EthioStudies group.</p>
        <p>This Group Library is use by several projects, so the <emph>ZoteroNS</emph> parameter has
            been set to that used by this project, <emph>bm:</emph>. One could haveThe project has
            also its own style, and therefore the <emph>ZoteroStyle</emph> parameter has been set to
            hiob-ludolf-centre-for-ethiopian-studies, the short name of the style saved in the CSL

    </div>
    <div>
        <head>Bibliographic citations</head>
        <p>Individual texts will often contain multiple bibliographic citations, for example to
            works cited in commentary, the source of translations or photographs, and most
            importantly, to previous publications of the same text by other scholars. Within an
            EpiDoc edition, such citations should be contained in the <tag>div
                type="bibliography"</tag>, either in an unstructured <gi>p</gi> (if the bibliography
            is a paragraph of free text with connecting prose such as, "First published in ..., from
            notebooks; reprinted in ...; whence ... . Later re-edited from autopsy by..." etc.) or
            in a <gi>listBibl</gi> if the citations are a simple (or numbered) list. </p>

        <p>Some projects prefer to create multiple <tag>div type="bibliography"</tag> sections for
            each text in order to group bibliographic citations thematically (e.g., prior editions,
            derivative editions, available illustrations, and the like. The <att>subtype</att> may
            be used to distinguish between them and to facilitate processing. In particular, lists
            of images published on-line or in print by third parties are sometimes encoded within
                <tag>div type="bibliography" subtype="illustrations"</tag>, regarding which see
            further <ref target="supp-images.html">Images, figures, and facsimile</ref>.</p>

        <p>Each bibliographic citation may be encoded relatively simply in a <gi>bibl</gi> element
            in the form that is desired in the online (or print) edition, be that a full
            bibliographic reference or abbreviated author + date or similar. It is often useful,
            however, to link back to the entry in a bibliographic authority (generally the master
            bibliography), for example so that: <list type="ordered">
                <item>edition can hyperlink back from short title to a full or even annotated
                    bibliography;</item>
                <item>bibliographic citations (full or short) can be automatically generated from
                    the main bibliography, providing more consistency and reducing the need for
                    multiple entry of identical information;</item>
                <item>a bibliographic concordance can be generated (using the <gi>idno</gi> of the
                    current edition, the <att>xml:id</att> of the bibliographic item, and the
                        <gi>citedRange</gi> of the bibliographic citation in the edition.</item>
            </list>
        </p>

        <p>Assuming a master bibliography in TEI containing the entries from the first example
            above, the bibliographic citation below would (a) point to the Reynolds 1971 title
            therein, and (b) state unambiguously that the text in whose edition this citation
            appears was previously published as number 3 in her edition.</p>

        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <bibl><ptr target="biblio.xml#jmr1971a"/>
                <citedRange>3</citedRange></bibl>
        </egXML>

        <p>This would allow, firstly, the edition to display text such as <q>Reynolds 1971, 3</q> or
                <q>Reynolds, 'Zawiet Msus' (1971), no. 3</q> or similar; and secondly a
            bibliographic concordance to be generated that lists all of the inscriptions in each
            previous publication, showing which inscription in the current collection corresponds to
            each. (See for example the <ref
                target="http://insaph.kcl.ac.uk/iaph2007/inscriptions/concordance/publication/jmr1980.html"
                >InsAph concordance</ref> for a Reynolds article.)</p>

        <p>The following example, adapted from the <ref target="http://iospe.kcl.ac.uk/index.html"
                >Ancient Inscriptions of the Northern Black Sea (IOSPE)</ref>, demonstrates the use
            of a single <tag>div type="bibliography"</tag> with two internal bibliographic lists of
            editions, one for each of two texts on the one support. Note the use of <gi>ptr</gi> to
            refer to bibliographic items in an external bibliographic list, as described above.</p>
