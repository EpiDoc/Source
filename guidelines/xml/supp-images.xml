    <head>Images, figures and facsimile</head>
    <p>Many EpiDoc projects will need to refer users to images of the text-bearing objects treated by the projects, and to other relevant
        imagery that provides context or comparison. Such images may be photographs or drawings ("copies") of the objects themselves 
        or of intermediary derivatives like squeezes, rubbings, and ink-transfers (estampages), as well as other kinds of maps, plans, and 
        illustrations. The TEI provides a variety of mechanisms for making reference to such visual materials, whether published alongside
        the textual material produced by the project or published by third parties online or in print.

    <p>When an EpiDoc project publishes digital images of an inscribed object alongside textual material, the TEI recommends the facsimile 
        element for indicating and describing the images and connecting them to the textual and analytic material.  The encoding approach
        outlined in the 
        <ref  target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/PH.html#PHFAX"

        should be followed by EpiDoc projects. The following examples illustrate the application of the facsimile element (and some of its 
        optional subordinate elements) in an EpiDoc context.

        may also provide helpful encoding patterns.
