    <head>Images, figures and facsimile</head>
    <p>Many EpiDoc projects will need to refer users to images of the text-bearing objects treated
        by the projects, and to other relevant imagery that provides context or comparison. Such
        images may be photographs or drawings ("copies") of the objects themselves or of
        intermediary derivatives like squeezes, rubbings, and ink-transfers (<foreign xml:lang="fr"
            >estampages</foreign>), as well as other kinds of maps, plans, and illustrations. The
        TEI provides a variety of mechanisms for making reference to such visual materials, whether
        published alongside the textual material produced by the project or published by third
        parties online or in print. </p>

        <head>Encoding Digital Imagery</head>
        <p>When an EpiDoc project publishes digital images of an inscribed object alongside textual
            material, the <gi>facsimile</gi> element should be used to list, link to, and describe
            the images, and to connect them to the textual and analytic material marked up elsewhere
            in the XML. The encoding approach outlined in the initial sections of the <ref

            portion of the <bibl><title>TEI Guidelines</title></bibl> also describes the use of the
                <gi>sourceDoc</gi> element, which should be used instead of <gi>facsimile</gi> when
            a project has comprehensive photographic documentation for a text-bearing object, and
            when the goals of the project and the character of the text call for a digital facsimile
            that contains a documentary transcription tied to the visible layout in the
            photographs.</p>
