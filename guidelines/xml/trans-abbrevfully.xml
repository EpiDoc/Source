    <p><gi>abbr</gi> (abbreviation) contains the abbreviated part, i.e. the letters actually on the stone/page.</p>
    <p><gi>expan</gi> (expanded word) contains the full expansion of an abbreviated word or term.</p>
    <p><gi>ex</gi> (editorial expansion) contains the letters added by the editor when expanding an abbreviation.</p>
    
    <p>In the simplest case of an abbreviation where a few letters are on the stone/support,
        and the editor expands this word by the addition of letters after the abbreviation—with parentheses
        in Leiden, for example "Aug(ustus)"—the TEI markup recommended by EpiDoc identifies three
        components of this word:</p>
    <list type="ordered">
        <item>the fully expanded word: the whole word, including both abbreviation and expansion, that appears
            in an editorial edition (in our example "Augustus"). This is tagged using the <gi>expan</gi> element.</item>
        <item>the abbreviation: the characters that are actually on the stone, or would appear in a diplomatic transcription
           (in our example "Aug" or "AVG"). These are tagged using the <gi>abbr</gi> element.</item>
        <item>the editorial expansion: the characters added by the editor in expanding the abbreviation
            (in our example, "ustus"). These are tagged with <gi>ex</gi>.</item>
    </list>
    
    <p>In full, our example would therefore be tagged so that each of the three elements contains the letters corresponding
    to the component in question, with no letters needing to be repeated:</p>
    
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <expan><abbr>Aug</abbr><ex>ustus</ex></expan>
        </egXML>

    <p>Resolved and unresolved abbreviations are treated slightly differently, in that there is no
        expanded word nor editorial expansion, so only the <gi>abbr</gi> (whose semantics is therefore
        unchanged) need be tagged.
        See <ref target="trans-abbrevnotex.html">Abbreviation not expanded at all</ref> for more detail
        on marking up abbreviations for which the expansion is unknown.</p>

    <note>Note that for historical reasons the Duke Databank does not use the <gi>abbr</gi>
        element for expanded abbreviations.</note>

        <expan><abbr>trib</abbr><ex>unicia</ex></expan>
    </egXML>
    
    <p>A suspended rather than abbreviated word is tagged in precisely the same way, with the undertstanding
        (both semantically and by processing such as rendering XSLT and indexing tools)
    that multiple <gi>abbr</gi> elements within a single <gi>expan</gi> are considered to compose
        a single abbreviation between them. For example, in the case of "QQ" expanding to "q(uin)q(uennalis)", we might
    encode as follows:</p>
    
    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
        <expan><abbr>q</abbr><ex>uin</ex><abbr>q</abbr><ex>uennalis</ex></expan>
    </egXML>

    <p>If the abbreviated text tacitly implies a supplementary word or words which are understood
        but omitted from the original support (e.g., <foreign xml:lang="la">tribu</foreign>,
        <foreign xml:lang="la">filius</foreign>, etc.), the abbreviation may be encoded in two
        different ways depending on the rendering desired. In the first, all omitted text is
        enclosed within <gi>ex</gi>. In the second, only the characters which form part of the word
        actually abbreviated are enclosed within <gi>ex</gi>, while the word(s) omitted but
        understood are enclosed within a <gi>supplied</gi> element, whose <att>reason</att>
        attribute should be given a value of "subaudible". See examples below.</p>
