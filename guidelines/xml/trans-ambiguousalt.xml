    <head>Ambiguous Characters with Alternatives Offered</head>
    <p>Sometimes an editor will record traces of a surviving ambiguous or damaged character, but rather
    than simply underdotting the chosen interpretation, she will list several possibilities (usually in an apparatus
    or note). This concept is encoded in EpiDoc using the <gi>choice</gi> element to group several 
        <gi>unclear</gi>s.</p>
