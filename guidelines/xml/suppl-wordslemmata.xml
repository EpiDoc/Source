    <p>Explicit markup of words and their lemmatization is optional. It is done with the 'word' element to markup lexical words as they appear on the monument.</p>
    <p>There are two ways to indicate the uninflected form of the word. In the first case, the 'word' element could have a 'lemma' attribute, where the uninflected form is put.
    In the second case, the 'word' element could have a 'lemmaRef' attribute, where a url to an online dictionary could be put, e. g. a reference to Perseus Digital Library.</p>
