    <head>Introduction and Organization</head>
        <p>The <bibl><title level="m">EpiDoc Guidelines</title></bibl> explain the use of the
            EpiDoc encoding scheme, which provides for the realization of electronic
            epigraphic editions, corpora and similar materials in the eXtensible Markup Language (XML). EpiDoc makes use of the 
        <xref href="http://www.tei-c.org">Text Encoding Initiative</xref> XML tagset, customizing it for epigraphic work.</p>
    <p>Several principles have been followed in developing these recommendations:</p>
    <list>
        <item>the markup language provides the same degrees of flexibility and rigor inherent in
            the format-oriented editing conventions employed by epigraphers in print</item>
        <item>format is separated from structure and meaning: therefore, characters may be used
            only to represent text characters and symbols; all editorial distinctions are made
            using structured markup </item>
        <item>rules laid down for the use of a given TEI tag in the <bibl><title level="m">TEI Guidelines</title></bibl> should be
            followed strictly by EpiDoc unless there is no appropriate encoding structure provided
            by TEI</item>
    </list>
        <p>The following sections provide a full introduction and orientation to the <bibl><title level="m">EpiDoc Guidelines</title></bibl>. They constitute 
            the essential starting point for new and prospective practitioners, as well as information technologists
            charged with supporting new EpiDoc projects.</p>
