    </ab>
    <p>Rigorous epigraphic publications indicate the type of object or monument on which the inscribed text appears.
        EpiDoc documents must include this information if they aim for EAGLE-conformance.</p>
    
    <p>Editors may include this information in their documents, either as <tag>keyword</tag>
        <tag>term</tag>s in the <tag>textClass</tag> portion of the <tag>teiHeader</tag> element,
        or, in the form of prose or text paragraphs, encapsulated in a <tag>div
        type="description"</tag> element. If an editor wishes to use multiple <tag>div
            type="description"</tag> elements for different descriptive aspects of the edition, the
        description element containing the material information should be specifically
        indicated by using the <soCalled>subtype</soCalled> attribute, and giving it a value of
            <soCalled>support</soCalled>.</p>
    
    <p>Whether information about the support is placed in the <tag>teiHeader</tag> or in a <tag>div type="description"</tag>, the following tagging examples
        must be followed closely for EAGLE conformance:</p>

        Values used in the text node of the <tag>rs</tag> element are at the discretion of the editor. Projects are encouraged to control
        the values in both the key attribute and the text node using DTD or schema modifications (or some other method) to speed
        data entry, reduce error and ensure uniformity across all documents in a publication or project.</p>
