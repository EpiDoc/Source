    <p>EpiDoc follows TEI practice in marking line breaks on the support (as opposed to verse lines) using the <tag>lb</tag> (line-break) empty element to mark the point at which the line breaks. (see <xref href="lines.xml">Lines</xref>.) In addition to marking epigraphic lines, which is obligatory, an editor may choose to tag verse groups and lines using the TEI <tag>lg</tag> (line-group) and <tag>l</tag> (line) elements.</p><p>Within the verse lines, however, the start of each line of text on the support still needs to be marked with an <tag>lb</tag> element. In other words, <tag>lg</tag> and <tag>l</tag> are replacing the containing <tag>ab</tag>, but <emph>not</emph> the <tag>lb</tag>s. (See example 2 below.)</p><p>The line-group and line elements may contain attributes recording metre, execution, rhyme, etc.</p><p>(Examples to be added)</p>
