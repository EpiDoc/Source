   <head>Controlled Vocabularies and Thesauri</head>
   <p>Many components of the documentation of an inscription can be linked to
      controlled lists so that they can be identified, verified, disambiguated,
      indexed or retrieved. Controlled lists are usefully applied to personal
      names, geographic locations or affiliations, object or inscription
      keywords, elements of physical description, etc. They can be developped by
      a project or for a particular corpus, but they are also very valuable when
      they make use of published authority lists or indices. For ex. several
      prosopographical and onomastic resources exist for antiquity, eg: PIR,
      LGPM, PLRE. The Barrington Atlas lists most place names known from
      Greco-Roman antiquity with unique IDs. LC classifications, Cornell list
      for art?? there are other examples.</p>
   <p>When using a controlled vocabulary, the source reference and any relevant
      information about how IDs are deployed should be documented in the TEI
      header <hi rend="strong">where?</hi>.</p>
    <p>For more information on specific vocabularies recommended for EpiDoc work or specified for 
        EAGLE conformance, see:</p>
