    <head>EpiDoc divisions (tei:div) of the text element (tei:text)</head>
    <p>The structure of an XML file containing the edition of an inscription or group of inscriptions marked up according to the EpiDoc standard is very flexible. Unlike a database or a single corpus, there is no requirement to follow a set pattern or page layout in an EpiDoc project. Some projects will focus more on some aspects of an inscriptions than others; some will distinguish object description from campus, others will have controlled vocabularies for object type or date. The only thing of importance in EpiDoc is that information of a certain type—where it is included—be explicitly identifiable by XML structure.</p><p>This is achieved by having a series of typed divisions available for use, each of which can contain a certain category of information. These divisions may appear in any order (although a project may wish to impose further consistency on this matter), may be omitted, duplicated, or nested as necessary, and may be given headings with any values as chosen by the individual project (in any language, needless to say). The divisions available are the following:
