            <specDesc key="ex"/>

    <p><gi>expan</gi> (expansion) contains the full expansion of an abbreviation.</p>
    <p><gi>ex</gi> (editorial expansion) contains a sequence of letters added by an editor or
        transcriber when expanding an abbreviation.</p>
    <p><gi>supplied</gi> signifies text supplied by the transcriber or editor.</p>


    <p>The characters that form the entire expansion of an abbreviation (including both the
        charaters that are present on the original support and those added by the editor) are marked
        up using <gi>expan</gi>.</p>
    <p>In addition, the characters added by the editor (i.e. those characters that do not appear on
        the original support) are indicated with <gi>ex</gi>.</p>
    <p>If the abbreviated text tacitly implies a supplementary word or words which are understood
        but omitted from the original support (e.g., <foreign xml:lang="la">tribu</foreign>,
            <foreign xml:lang="la">filius</foreign>, etc.), the abbreviation may be encoded in two
        different ways depending on the rendering desired. In the first, all omitted text is
        enclosed within <gi>ex</gi>. In the second, only the characters which form part of the word
        actually abbreviated are enclosed within <gi>ex</gi>, while the word(s) omitted but
        understood are enclosed within a <gi>supplied</gi> element, whose <att>reason</att>
        attribute should be given a value of "subaudible". See examples below.</p>
    <p>Resolved and unresolved abbreviations are treated differently; see <ref
            target="trans-abbrevnotex.html">Abbreviation not expanded at all</ref> for an
        explanation of how to mark up abbreviations for which the expansion is unknown.</p>
