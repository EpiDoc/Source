        <p><gi>gap</gi> (gap) indicates a point where material has been omitted in a transcription,
            whether for editorial reasons described in the TEI header, as part of sampling practice,
            or because the material is illegible, invisible, or inaudible.</p>
        <p><gi>name</gi> BLAH BLAH</p>
    
    
       
        <p>Where characters have been lost on the original support and there is nothing to indicate
            to the editor how these should be restored, this is marked up as a lacuna using the
            <gi>gap</gi> element. Note that this is usually an empty element, as it marks a point at
            which the lacuna occurs, and therefore does not contain any content (see sections VIII.7
            for examples in which <gi>gap</gi> can contain other elements).</p>
        <p>For a straightforward lacuna whose extent is known, <gi>gap</gi> should take the following
            three attributes:</p>
        <list type="bulleted">
            <item><att>reason</att> explains why the text has been restored, and for a lacuna is given
                the value "lost" (other values denote other kinds of non-transcribable text).</item>
            <item><att>quantity</att> indicates how many characters or lines have been lost (where
                known).</item>
            <item><att>unit</att> indicates what kind of textual unit has been lost, such as "character" or
                "line" (or indeed some other type of textual unit such as "column", "page"
                etc.).</item>
        </list>
        <p>In cases in which a praenomen has been lost, the quantity of characters missing should be
            extrapolated (this is usually between 1 and 3 letters). Therefore, in addition to the
            <att>reason</att> and <att>unit</att> attributes, a further two attributes should be used:</p>
        <list type="bulleted">
            <item><att>atLeast</att> indicates the minimum number of characters lost.</item>
            <item><att>atMost</att> indicates the maximum number of characters lost.</item>
        </list>
        <p>The <gi>gap</gi> element should also be placed inside a <gi>name</gi> element, to denote
            the fact that the editor considers the lacuna to have contained a name rather than
            another type of word.</p>
