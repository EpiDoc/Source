        <p><gi>expan</gi> (expansion) contains the expansion of an abbreviation.</p>

            transcriber when expanding an abbreviation.</p>
    
        <head>EpiDoc</head>
        <p>The characters that form the entire expansion of an abbreviation (including both the
            charaters that are present on the original support and those added by the editor) are
            marked up using <gi>expan</gi>.</p>
        <p>In addition, the characters added by the editor (i.e. those characters that do not appear
            on the original support) are indicated with <gi>ex</gi>.</p>
        <p>Resolved and unresolved abbreviations are treated differently; see section X.2 for an
            explanation of how to mark up abbreviations for which the expansion is unknown.</p>
