        <p><gi>gap</gi> (gap) indicates a point where material has been omitted in a transcription,
            whether for editorial reasons described in the TEI header, as part of sampling practice,
            or because the material is illegible, invisible, or inaudible.</p>
    
    
       
        <p>Where characters have been lost on the original support and there is nothing to indicate
            to the editor how these should be restored, this is marked up as a lacuna using the
            <gi>gap</gi> element. Note that this is usually an empty element, as it marks a point at
            which the lacuna occurs, and therefore does not contain any content (see sections VIII.7
            for examples in which <gi>gap</gi> can contain other elements).</p>
        <p>Important: whereas in cases in which the number of characters lost is known to the
            editor, the attribute @quantity is used, in the case of an unknown number of characters
            being lost we use:</p>
        <list type="bulleted">
            <item>@extent with a value of "unknown" denotes the fact that it is not possible to
                determine how many characters have been lost.</item>
        </list>
        <p><gi>gap</gi> should also take the following attributes:</p>
        <list type="bulleted">
            <item>@reason explains why the text has been restored, and for a lacuna is usually given
                the value "lost" (although other values are possible).</item>
            <item>@unit indicates what kind of textual unit has been lost, such as "character" or
                "line" (or indeed some other type of textual unit such as "column", "page"
                etc.).</item>
        </list>
