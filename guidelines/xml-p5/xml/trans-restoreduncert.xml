        <p>Where text not present in the source is supplied (whether conjecturally or from other
            witnesses) to fill an apparent gap in the text, the <gi>supplied</gi> element may be
            used. <gi>supplied</gi> signifies text supplied by the transcriber or editor for any
            reason, typically because the original cannot be read because of physical damage or loss
            to the original.</p>
        <p>@reason indicates why the text has had to be supplied.</p>
    
    
        
        <p><gi>supplied</gi> indicates text lost from the original support, restored by the editor
            either by comparison with other texts or through other contextual knowledge.</p>
        <p>Required attributes: <list type="bulleted">
                <item>@reason explains why the text has been restored, and for text restored in
                    lacunae, is given the value "lost" (although other values are possible).</item>
            </list></p>
        <p>Optional attributes include: <list type="bulleted">
                <item>@cert indicates text that is uncertainly restored.</item>
