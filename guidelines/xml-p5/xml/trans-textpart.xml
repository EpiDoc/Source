    <p>Units of the text that are separated and usually numbered independently by
        epigraphers—including fragments, columns, sections, chapters, independent texts on a single
        stone, marks, stamps, or graffiti grouped together — should be similarly divided and
        numbered in EpiDoc. Each division containing a separate unit of text should be wrapped in a
        separate <gi>ab</gi> inside a <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
            corresp="#london"><div type="textpart"/></egXML> (the <att>subtype</att> attribute may
        also name the kind of textpart being encoded in the form, e.g. <egXML
            xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" rend="london" corresp="#london"><div type="textpart"
                subtype="column"/></egXML>. Its values are unrestricted.</p>

    <p>These units may, of course, nest in almost any combination. If there are non-hierarchical
        overlaps between units (e.g. sections and columns) then one unit has to be selected as the
        "top level" division, and the other broken up between the larger division. These smaller,
        broken divisions may be connected using the <att>n</att> attribute or a <gi>link</gi>
        element.</p>

    <p>Where a unit within a single, continuous text need to be marked (for example, multiple blocks
        in a long relief text) the <gi>milestone</gi> element should be used instead to mark the
        point at which a break in the support occurs.</p>
