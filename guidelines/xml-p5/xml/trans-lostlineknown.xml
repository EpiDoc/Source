        <p>A <gi>gap</gi> indicates a point at which material has been omitted in a transcription,
            whether for editorial reasons described in the TEI header, as part of sampling practice,
            or because the material is illegible, invisible, or inaudible.</p>
    
   
       
        <p>Where lines have been lost on the original support and there is nothing to indicate to
            the editor how these should be restored, this is marked up as a lacuna using 
            <gi>gap</gi>. Note that this is usually an empty element, as it marks a point at
            which the lacuna occurs, and therefore does not contain any content<!--(see sections VIII.7
            for examples in which <gi>gap</gi> can contain other elements)-->.</p>
        <p>For a straightforward lacuna whose extent is known, <gi>gap</gi> should take the following
            three attributes:</p>
        <list type="bulleted">
            <item><att>reason</att> explains why the text has been restored, and for a lacuna is usually given
                the value "lost" (although other values are possible).</item>
            <item><att>quantity</att> indicates how many characters or lines have been lost (where
                known).</item>
            <item><att>unit</att> indicates what kind of textual unit has been lost, such as "character" or
                "line" (or indeed some other type of textual unit such as "column", "page"
                etc.).</item>
        </list>
