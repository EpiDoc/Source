    <p> (pref Unicode?)</p>
    <p>It is an assumption in EpiDoc that these characters should and will eventually be included in Unicode, at which point the markup
        we use will change (although some markup will still be necessary for purposes of traditional rendering, searching, etc.).
        In the meantime, the markup listed above should be used.</p>
