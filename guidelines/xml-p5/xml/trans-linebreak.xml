    <!-- Following text taken from P4 Guidelines -->
    <p>EpiDoc follows TEI practice in marking line breaks on the support (as opposed to verse lines) using the <gi>lb</gi>
        (line-breakGB 2007-05-23: though I use the expansion "line-begins" when presenting this to students) empty element
        to mark the point at which the line breaks.</p>

    <p>Because there is no containing element encapsulating lines, any information about the numbering, rendition, or condition
        of an entire line need to be marked in an attribute on the preceeding <gi>lb</gi>. For this reason, therefore, it is
        our convention to place an <gi>lb</gi> at the beginning of every epigraphic line in the edition, including the first.
        Any <att>rend</att> or numbering attributes on that <gi>lb</gi> refer to all text between the current at the following line-break.
        (See example 1 below.)</p>
    
    <p>An <gi>lb</gi> that occurs mid-word should be given an attribute type="worddiv" (this, among other things, generates
        the hyphen at the end of the preceding line in XSLT).</p>
                
    <p>See also <ref>direction of text</ref>.</p>
