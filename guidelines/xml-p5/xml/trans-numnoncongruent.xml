    <p>Some numbers, especially if they are damaged or incomplete, can be partially but not completely interpreted.
    Unlike those whose possible values can be expressed as a <ref target="trans-numrange.html">numerical range</ref>,
    the examples offered here are of numbers whose values are non-sequential; for instance, a two-digit number where
    the units value survives, but the tens unit does not.</p>
