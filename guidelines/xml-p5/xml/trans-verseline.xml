    <!-- Following text is taken from P4 Guidelines -->
    <p>EpiDoc follows TEI practice in marking line breaks on the support (as opposed to verse lines) using the <gi>lb</gi>
        (line-break) empty element to mark the point at which the line breaks. (see Lines.) In addition to marking epigraphic
        lines, which is obligatory, an editor may choose to tag verse groups and lines using the TEI <gi>lg</gi> (line-group)
        and <gi>l</gi> (line) elements.</p>

    <p>Within the verse lines, however, the start of each line of text on the support still needs to be marked with an <gi>lb</gi>
        element. In other words, <gi>lg</gi> and <gi>l</gi> are replacing the containing <gi>ab</gi>, but not the <gi>lb</gi>s.
        (See example 2 below.)</p>
    
    <p>The line-group and line elements may contain attributes recording metre, execution, rhyme, etc.</p>
