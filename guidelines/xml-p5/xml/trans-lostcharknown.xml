    <p>A <gi>gap</gi> (gap) indicates a point at which material has been omitted in a transcription,
        whether for editorial reasons described in the TEI header, as part of sampling practice, or
        because the material is illegible, invisible, or inaudible.</p>

    <p>Where characters have been lost on the original support and there is nothing to indicate to
        the editor how these should be restored, this is marked up as a lacuna using 
            <gi>gap</gi>. Note that this is usually an empty element, as it marks a point at
        which the lacuna occurs, and therefore does not contain any content<!-- (see sections VIII.7 for
        examples in which <gi>gap</gi> can contain other elements)-->.</p>
    <p>For a straightforward lacuna whose extent is known, <gi>gap</gi> should take the following
        three attributes:</p>
    <list type="bulleted">
        <item><att>reason</att> explains why the text has been restored, and for a lacuna is usually given the
            value "lost" (although other values are possible).</item>
        <item><att>quantity</att> indicates how many characters or lines have been lost (where known).</item>
        <item><att>unit</att> indicates what kind of textual unit has been lost, such as "character" or "line"
            (or indeed some other type of textual unit such as "column", "page" etc.).</item>
    </list>
