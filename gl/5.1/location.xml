   <p>Rigorous epigraphic publications provide detailed information on the geographic aspects of each inscription, insofar as these 
   are known to the editor or can be recovered. Apart from any geographic content inherent or implicit in the text itself (e.g., 
   place names, for which see <xref href="geographicnames.xml">Geographic Names</xref>), epigraphic editions normally provide users with information about the modern place of finding (and the name of 
   any associated ancient settlement), as well as the last known or observed location (complete with any appropriate inventory numbers).
   EpiDoc documents must include this information, insofar as it is known, if they aim for EAGLE-conformance.</p>
    
   <p>Editors may include this information in their documents, either as &lt;keyword&gt; &lt;term&gt;s in the &lt;textClass&gt; portion of the &lt;teiHeader&gt; element,
   or, in the form of prose or text paragraphs, encapsulated in a &lt;div type="description"&gt; element.  If an editor wishes to use multiple
   &lt;div type="description"&gt; elements for different descriptive aspects of the edition, the description element containing the location 
   information should be specifically indicated by using the <soCalled>subtype</soCalled> attribute, and giving it a value of <soCalled>location</soCalled>.</p>
    
    <p>Whether location information is placed in the &lt;teiHeader&gt; or in a &lt;div type="description"&gt;, the following tagging guidance
        must be followed closely for EAGLE conformance:</p>
