    <head>Transcribing and Editing the Text</head>
    <p>The creation of epigraphic texts using XML is greatly facilitated by the
        traditional, scholarly techniques of editing epigraphic texts. Epigraphers are already
        accustomed to careful examination, analysis and description of letters, words, phrases and
        other aspects of texts. Communicating these aspects accurately and unambiguously is the
        central aim of scholarly epigraphic publication, and epigraphers have developed a highly
        technical and effective typographic vocabulary for achieving it (see further: "
        <xref href="introeps.xml">Introduction for Epigraphers</xref>").  Our goal in developing the guidelines in this section has been to render structurally distinct the semantic richness
        and rigor underlying the typographic vocabulary to permit computer software to distinguish all its elements reliably.
        This arrangement permits the use of xml-aware software 
        to increase scholarly productivity and reduce the manual tasks that slow scholarly
        inquiry. </p>
    <p>The use of sigla in traditional typographic
        editions that either bind to individual characters or that encompass a group of characters
        pair-wise provides a ready-made road map to the enumeration and application of XML tags. In
        formulating these recommendations, we have endeavored to provide
        unique combinations of elements and attributes for each and every distinction epigraphers
        attempt to draw with sigla in print editions. These element-attribute combinations are
        described in the following sections, arranged by broad classes of editorial activity.</p>
    <p>Note that this section focuses exclusively on the transcription and editing of the inscribed
        text, i.e., the specific activities in which an epigraphist engages to constitute a text and
        associated apparatus. Other aspects of epigraphic editions, reports and corpora are
        presented elsewhere in these <bibl>
