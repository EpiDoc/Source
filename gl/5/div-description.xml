   <p>Describing monuments, texts, lettering, etc. (tei:div type="description") </p>
   <p>In the InsAph project divisions of this type are used to contain the description of the monument/object, of the text face (field or campus), of lettering and notable text features. In some projects this information may be included in "physical commentary"; the @type of the div in EpiDoc does not prejudice the name you give to this division of the edition.</p>

   <p>Text Coloration. Where traces of paint survive in letter cuts, these should recorded in the physical description of the inscription, possibly using an <tag>rs</tag> tag with appropriate attributes.  Sections of text highlighted, for example by gilding, may be distinguished with a <tag>hi</tag> tag with appropriate attributes in the mark-up of the text.
