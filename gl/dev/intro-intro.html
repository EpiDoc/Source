It describes how to encode the various features of epigraphic and papyrological documents, based on the core principles of scholarly text editing (e.g. the so-called <a xmlns="" class="glossary" href="app-glossary.html#leiden" title="Leiden, Leiden Conventions: A set of rules for the encoding of classical epigraphic and papyrological texts using simple, arbitrary and unambiguous symbols to represent editorial observations and interventions, e.g. '[' and ']' for lost text (restored or lacuna).

Neither are the <span class="titlem">Guidelines</span> a full introduction to epigraphy or papyrology; they are exclusively a guide to the XML encoding of the features of an ancient documentary text edition that are most often needed in epigraphic and similar scholarship.</p><p>Although there is no single convention for the structure of an epigraphic or papyrological edition, the <span class="titlem">EpiDoc Guidelines</span> (and the <span class="titlem"><a xmlns="" class="glossary" title="">EpiDoc Stylesheets</a></span>) take an approach that is in accord with the data models employed by projects and collaborations like the <a xmlns="" class="glossary" href="app-bibliography.html#apis" title="Advanced Papyrological Information System (APIS): Advanced Papyrological Information System (APIS)">Advanced Papyrological Information System (APIS)</a>, <a xmlns="" class="glossary" href="app-bibliography.html#eagle" title="EAGLE: Electronic Archive of Greek and Latin Epigraphy (EAGLE), available: www.eagle-eagle.it/">EAGLE</a>, and <a xmlns="" class="glossary" href="app-bibliography.html#petrae" title="Programme d’enregistrement, de traitement et de recherche automatique en épigraphie (PETRAE): Programme d’enregistrement, de traitement et de recherche automatique en épigraphie (PETRAE), available: http://petrae.tge-adonis.fr/index.php"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Programme d’enregistrement, de traitement et de recherche automatique en épigraphie</span> (PETRAE)</a>. As the discipline of epigraphy in general, and digital epigraphy in particular, already have rigorous models of good practice in structuring editions, we merely recommend the encoding in TEI XML of the same data and observations that scholars have already found essential or useful in practice.</p><p>The <span class="titlem">EpiDoc Guidelines</span> are intended to complement the <a xmlns="" class="glossary" href="app-glossary.html#leiden" title="Leiden, Leiden Conventions: A set of rules for the encoding of classical epigraphic and papyrological texts using simple, arbitrary and unambiguous symbols to represent editorial observations and interventions, e.g. '[' and ']' for lost text (restored or lacuna). There are several minor variations on Leiden now in use (Krummrey-Panciera and PETRAE perhaps prominent among them). A good summary of Leiden can be found at en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden_Conventions">Leiden Conventions</a> (hereafter "Leiden"), which have been in use in epigraphy and papyrology for over 80 years and are understood in many philological and documentary fields. The <span class="titlem">Guidelines</span> assume that Leiden is an adequate basis for the intellectual distinctions recorded in an edition of a pre-modern text, and base their recommendations and examples upon these distinctions without requiring the specific typographical conventions and sigla recommended therein. That is, EpiDoc seeks clearly to record in XML such textual interventions as an editor's supplement for characters wholly lost to damage, but does not specify that such supplements must be rendered within "square brackets" ("[" and "]") in the XML itself or in any downstream output. That said, it is the default behaviour of the <span class="titlem">EpiDoc Example Stylesheets</span> to produce a Leiden rendering of EpiDoc-encoded texts. It is often possible for TEI to record distinctions that are finer or deeper than Leiden, and some such possibilities are described herein, but these <span class="titlem">Guidelines</span> do not recommend replacing standard epigraphic or papyrological practice with such new principles.</p><p>The <span class="titlem">Guidelines</span> produced and recommended by the EpiDoc community represent a subset of and refinement to the <span class="titlem"><a class="link_ref" href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html">TEI Guidelines</a></span>, which recommend the XML encoding of a wide range of literary and historical texts and linguistic corpora. Just as EpiDoc is a specialization of the TEI for ancient documents and objects, recommending only those elements, attributes and objects of value for this specific sub-community, the <span class="titlem">EpiDoc Guidelines</span> are intended to supplement (and by no means replace) the <span class="titlem">TEI Guidelines</span>. Especially the reference and technical sections of the TEI remain an invaluable resource for users of EpiDoc, who will often find lists of elements, explanations of attribute values or data types, examples of usage in a wide range of contexts and extensive prose descriptions of markup features useful. The <span class="titlem">EpiDoc Guidelines</span> recommend a rather restricted set of TEI elements, content models, attributes and values, such that an EpiDoc file is always also a valid TEI file, but not every TEI file is valid EpiDoc. Where the <span class="titlem">EpiDoc Guidelines</span> are more restrictive than the TEI, the former should be considered to supercede the latter; but where the TEI goes into more detail, or offers a more useful range of examples, it should of course be consulted and considered the canonical source for all EpiDoc usage.</p><div class="teidiv1" id="structure"><h2><span class="head">Structure and Features of the <span class="titlem">EpiDoc Guidelines</span></span></h2><p>There are several pathways into the individual pages that make up the body of the <span class="titlem">EpiDoc Guidelines</span>.</p><ul><li class="item">Three main tables of contents collect together all of these pages under the categories: <a style="font-weight:bold" href="app-alltrans.html">Transcription</a> (those features relating to the content, appearance, restoration and basic interpretation of the text itself); <a style="font-weight:bold" href="app-allsupp.html">Supporting Data</a> (including the description of the object or manuscript, the history of the object and its discovery, bibliographical and other editorial information); and <a style="font-weight:bold" href="app-allidx.html">Vocabulary and Indexing</a> (terms and features tagged in the text for purpose of vocabulary control or indexing, searching and faceting).</li><li class="item"><a class="link_ref" href="index.html#special">Several sections</a> offer organized and selected lists of guidance pages according to the categories generally followed by users of specialized communities (for example, the epigraphic transcription guidelines of <a xmlns="" class="glossary" href="app-bibliography.html#krummreypanciera" title="Krummrey-Panciera: Hans Krummrey and Silvio Panciera, Criteri di edizione e segni diacritici in Tituli 2 (1980), 205-215">Krummrey-Panciera</a>; the papyrological features as recorded by the <a xmlns="" class="glossary" href="app-bibliography.html#apis" title="APIS: Advanced Papyrological Information System (APIS)">APIS</a> database). These sections are under construction, and should be considered informational rather than normative. Suggestions of new sections of this kind are welcome.</li><li class="item">Finally the <span class="titlem">Guidelines</span> contain supporting appendices, such as the <a class="link_ref" href="app-glossary.html">glossary of technical and specialized terms</a>, and a <a class="link_ref" href="app-bibliography.html">bibliography</a> of epigraphic and papyrological authorities, example EpiDoc corpora, and on digital publication of ancient texts generally. An <a class="link_ref" href="app-elements.html">index to the <span class="titlem">Guidelines</span> by TEI elements mentioned</a> allows readers to find all epigraphic features in which a given element is part of the recommended usage.</li></ul><p>Individual pages in the <span class="titlem">Guidelines</span> are organised by epigraphic or papyrological concept, rather than by TEI element name. So, for instance, all pages involving abbreviations are grouped together (<a class="link_ref" href="app-alltrans.html#editorial-interventions">under the Editorial Interventions rubric</a>), regardless of what TEI elements are specified. Each <span class="titlem">Guidelines</span> page has a regular structure: first, a brief explanation of the title of a page (e.g., for <a class="link_ref" href="trans-uninterpreted.html">the page entitled ‘Uninterpreted Characters’</a>, there is an explanation “Clear but incomprehensible letters”). The relevant TEI element (or elements) are displayed in a box underneath, including a link to the <span class="titlem">TEI Guidelines</span> page for that element. There then follows a prose explanation of the EpiDoc recommendations for the use of those TEI elements, including details of relevant attributes and values.</p><p>Below this explanation there are usually a few examples of the usage in context. Especially in the case of transcriptional features, the <span class="titlem">Guidelines</span> will list conventional renderings of the issue in question according to common epigraphic or papyrological transcription guidelines, such as <a xmlns="" class="glossary" href="app-bibliography.html#krummreypanciera" title="Krummrey-Panciera: Hans Krummrey and Silvio Panciera, Criteri di edizione e segni diacritici in Tituli 2 (1980), 205-215">Krummrey-Panciera</a> and the <a xmlns="" class="glossary" href="app-bibliography.html#ddb" title="Duke Databank: Duke Databank of Documentary Papyri (DDbDP)">Duke Databank</a>.</p><p>The XML examples show the recommended markup for the various types of each transcriptional feature, e. g. different cases of <a class="link_ref" href="trans-abbrevmark.html">expansion of an abbreviation which includes a symbol</a>. The examples often list several markup options depending on the level of detail desired. Below the examples there is a series of renderings (or a different rendering after each example) which represent the several outputs available in the example EpiDoc P5 stylesheets. The default output is following the <a xmlns="" class="glossary" href="app-bibliography.html#krummreypanciera" title="Krummrey-Panciera: Hans Krummrey and Silvio Panciera, Criteri di edizione e segni diacritici in Tituli 2 (1980), 205-215">Krummrey-Panciera</a> conventions. The others include the SEG style, the London style and the DDbDP style. Below each example there is a reference pointing to its source. Most of the examples are taken from the <a xmlns="" class="glossary" href="app-bibliography.html#iaph" title="Inscriptions of Aphrodisias: Inscriptions of Aphrodisias (IAph)">Inscriptions of Aphrodisias</a>, the <a xmlns="" class="glossary" href="app-bibliography.html#irt" title="Inscriptions of Roman Tripolitania: Inscriptions of Roman Tripolitania (IRT)">Inscriptions of Roman Tripolitania</a> and the <a xmlns="" class="glossary" href="app-bibliography.html#ddb" title="Duke Databank of Documentary Papyri: Duke Databank of Documentary Papyri (DDbDP)">Duke Databank of Documentary Papyri</a>.</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="more"><h2><span class="head">Training, Tools, and Support</span></h2><p>These <span class="titlem">Guidelines</span> are in essence a reference source.
