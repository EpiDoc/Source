A QUICK EXPLANATION OF FILES IN THIS MODULE

epiMetaOdds.xml: defines the schema for writing the EpiDoc guidelines
		 ODD document (i.e., epiMetaDoc.xml); very similar to
		 TEI's p5odds.odd.

epiMetaOdds.rnc: the schema generated from epiMetaOdds.xml. Currently
		 this is the only derived file that is routinely
		 checked-in to the Sourceforge repository, which is
		 done to facilitate editing the epiMetaDoc.xml file.
		 This schema is currently only expressed as RelaxNG
		 compact syntax for no reason other than both the
		 current authors (ZA & SB) use that format.

epiMetaDoc-ex.xml: a separate ODD that defines a schema against which
		   the examples (i.e., the <egXML> elements) in the
		   EpiDoc guidelines can be validated. As currently
		   configured this does not even produce a valid
		   schema, let alone provice all the constraints we
		   want, but it's a start. Part of the problem is my
		   Roma build process is still building this against
		   TEI P5 source, when it should be run against the
		   EpiMetaDoc ODD.

epiMetaDoc.nrl: the Namespace Routing Language schema that, in theory,
		permits `jing` to simultaneously validate the
		guidelines document against 
		- epiMetaDoc.rng for the main 
		- epiMetaDoc-ex.rng for the examples
		- epiMetaDoc.sch too
		Untested.

epiMetaDoc.xml: the main ODD file that defines the language for the
		EpiDoc guidelines.

generate.bash: a front-end to roma. Should be issued from the
	       schema-gl working copy, i.e. the same directory that
	       contains the epiMetaDoc.xml ODD file. Produces
	       - epiMetaDoc.rnc & .rng = the schema files
	       - epiMetaDoc.doc.html = the reference documentation in HTML
	       - epiMetaDoc.doc.xml = the reference documentation in TEI

validate.bash: a script for running a variety of validation processses
	       over the guidelines. Intended to be run not from this
	       directory, but from the guidelines/ working copy.
	       Untested.
