A QUICK OVERVIEW OF EPIDOC VALIDATION

Note: this explanations refer to the not-yet-existing P5 version of
      the EpiDoc guidelines in the present tense.

The EpiDoc Guidelines are themselves a TEI P5 customization ODD.
However, the EpiDoc Guidelines call for a somewhat different document
structure than your standard run-of-the-mill reference documentation.
In order to accomadate that structure, a more specialized schema than
TEI with tagset documentation is required. 'epiMetaDoc' is that
schema.

'epiMetaDoc' is a TEI customization that supports the writing of the
EpiDoc Guidelines. The EpiDoc Guidelines are themselves a TEI
customization that support the encoding of epigraphic materials. 

That is sufficient information for most folks. For the real TEI
customization die-hards, there is one more level of complexity that is
interesting. Normally, a TEI customization conforms to the same TEI
customization that we use to create the TEI Guidelines themselves,
called 'p5odds'. However, in creating 'epiMetaDoc', we discovered
there were some points of friction, and thus have developed
'epiMetaOdds', a customization for writing 'epiMetaDoc'.


A QUICK EXPLANATION OF FILES IN THIS MODULE

epiMetaOdds.xml: defines the schema for writing the EpiDoc guidelines
		 ODD document (i.e., epiMetaDoc.xml); very similar to
		 TEI's p5odds.odd.

epiMetaOdds.rnc: the schema generated from epiMetaOdds.xml. Currently
		 this is the only derived file that is routinely
		 checked-in to the Sourceforge repository, which is
		 done to facilitate editing the epiMetaDoc.xml file.
		 This schema is currently only expressed as RelaxNG
		 compact syntax for no reason other than both the
		 current authors (ZA & SB) use that format.

epiMetaDoc-ex.xml: a separate ODD that defines a schema against which
		   the examples (i.e., the <egXML> elements) in the
		   EpiDoc guidelines can be validated. As currently
		   configured this does not even produce a valid
		   schema, let alone provice all the constraints we
		   want, but it's a start. Part of the problem is my
		   Roma build process is still building this against
		   TEI P5 source, when it should be run against the
		   EpiMetaDoc ODD.

epiMetaDoc.nrl: the Namespace Routing Language schema that, in theory,
		permits `jing` to simultaneously validate the
		guidelines document against 
		- epiMetaDoc.rng for the main 
		- epiMetaDoc-ex.rng for the examples
		- epiMetaDoc.sch too
		Untested.

epiMetaDoc.xml: the main ODD file that defines the language for the
		EpiDoc guidelines.

generate.bash: a front-end to roma. Should be issued from the
	       schema-gl working copy, i.e. the same directory that
	       contains the epiMetaDoc.xml ODD file. Produces
	       - epiMetaDoc.rnc & .rng = the schema files
	       - epiMetaDoc.doc.html = the reference documentation in HTML
	       - epiMetaDoc.doc.xml = the reference documentation in TEI

validate.bash: a script for running a variety of validation processses
	       over the guidelines. Intended to be run not from this
	       directory, but from the guidelines/ working copy.
	       Untested.
