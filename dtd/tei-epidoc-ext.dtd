     This file has three major sections:
     1: New elements added by EpiDoc, together with their attributes 
     2: EpiDoc-specific attributes (to override or make more stringent those specified by the TEI
     3. EpiDoc-specific character entities 
     
     REVISION HISTORY:

     09 August 2005
           (GB)
         * new content model for <unclear>: can only contain PCDATA or <mark>

     04 April 2005
           (GB and JG)
         * made <figure> a little more forgiving (for InsAph compatibility)
         * Added <w> and <rs> (added %paracontent; to content model of <w>)
         * made the @from and @to in <app> CDATA #IMPLIED
         * made @cert CDATA #IMPLIED (globally)
         * made <date> @precision ( exact | circa )
         * made <div> @type CDATA #IMPLIED
         * added 'superscript' to values of @rend in <hi>
         * added @type to place-names
         * added 'abbreviation' to @reason in <supplied>

     25 November 2002
         * Added an "href" attribute to the figure tag to support 'quick-and-dirty' direct linkage
           of images and EpiDoc documents. This is a stop-gap until both TEI and EpiDoc finally 
           decide on new, fully robust XML-based handling for image linkage.
         * Altered the content model for figure to require a head and a figDesc child at least. <text>
           children are not allowed.

     22 August 2002 (many thanks to Gabriel Bodard, Charles Crowther and Jessica Ratcliff)
         * Added attribute customization for <persName> and <placeName>
         * Added enumeration for values for the "dim" attribute on the <gap> tag to reflect G.B.'s 
           recommendation of 11 September 2002 to reconcile usage between EPAPP and Vindolanda
         * Added "precision", "notBefore", "notAfter", and "exact" attributes to the <date> and 
           <dateStruct> tags to support recommendations made by G.B.
         * Added "cert" attribute to the <supplied> tag to support EPAPP
         * Added "value" attribute to the <measure> tag to support EPAPP
     17 August 2002 (many thanks to Gabriel Bodard for identifying these needs to support EPAPP)
         * added GNU public license
         * modified attributes for <mark> to include all the global ones, not just type
         * modified some of the attributes for <measure> so that type, dim and value are all CDATA
           and #IMPLIED, nothing more stringent. Note that "dim" is an extension used by EPAPP
         * removed the epidoc.cert parameter entity entirely to allow the less restrictive "cert" 
           attribute that is the default in TEI to remain on all relevant elements until we reach 
           a consensus on how to do certainty in epidoc
         * added dim attribute to value tag until EPAPP and Vindolanda can develop a consensus on
           how to deal with various gap issues ... and that consensus has been vetted via the markup
           list
           
     12 August 2002 (many thanks to Jessica Ratcliff for identifying these needs)
         * modified the attribute list for the <gap> element to make the 'reason' attribute optional,
           on the following grounds (Ratcliff): "it may be difficult for us [Vindolanda project] to 
           give data for REASON, which is currently required. Since we are not working with the actual 
           tablets but Bowman and Thomas' book, we do not necessarily have the info for why a gap 
           exists. I can imagine other similar situations, and wonder whether or not REASON should be 
           required." THIS CHANGE NEEDS TO BE VETTED VIA THE MARKUP LIST. -->
