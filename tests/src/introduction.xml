    <p>If a project uses standard XML tools and TEI/EpiDoc markup--or if that project has created a
        translation application to move documents between XML/EpiDoc and their own internal format
        or database--then sharing documents between projects becomes as simple as telling the
        software where to find the new file. Manual conversion of data and re-entering of texts will
        become a thing of the past because there is enough information in the text itself to permit
        software to make necessary conversion decisions unaided. </p>
    <p>Beyond the tremendous benefits to be realized from project-to-project data sharing,
        individual projects can gain other advantages from adopting EpiDoc techniques. One can
        imagine a website in which customizable user preferences dictate whether standard glosses
        for the various division types are presented to or hidden from the user (i.e., a helpful,
        student-oriented interface vs. a compact, streamlined view for scholars). A search engine
        packaged with a CDROM of texts could search for date ranges found only in 'description'
        divisions, for Latin abbreviations found only in 'edition' divisions, or for English words
        appearing only in 'translation' divisions. In assembling a large database of inscriptions,
        an automated process could easily be put to the task of reading all the entries from the
        'bibliography' divisions of hundreds of individual texts prepared by a number of different
        projects, then collating the citations into a single master bibliography file for the entire
        database. </p>
