   <head>The Epigraphic Edition</head>
   
    
<p>Presenting the epigraphic text itself (tei:div type="edition")</p><div><head>General</head><p>This section describes the division in which the  edition of the epigraphic text itself is encoded. The edition of an inscription consists of the transcribed inscription with editorial interventions that regularize the text so that it can be read more easily.  </p><p>The detailed guidelines concerning the markup of traditionally transcribed issues are found under the heading of <xref id="taggingtext.xml">Tagging the Inscribed Text</xref>.</p></div><div><head>Particulars</head><p>An edition is tagged using the <tag>div @type='edition'</tag> element. There can be multiple editions of the same text; each edition should be enclosed in its own separate <tag>div @type='edition'</tag>.</p><p>Authority for each edition is recorded in the corresponding <xref href="divhistory">source section of history</xref>, and in the corresponding external <xref href="divapparatuscriticus.xml">apparatus criticus</xref>. The edition is linked to its corresponding sections (how?); if there is but a single edition, the link may be considered to be implicit.</p><p>The edition division can also be used to record a consolidated edition (similar to an eclectic manuscript editionâ€”e.g. brick-stamps, coins, Diocletian's Prices Edict, <title>Res Gestae</title>, Athenian Standards Decree, etc.). This is likely to require more involved apparatus and references. The individual inscriptions that form the basis of this edition should be documented in the 'source' division.</p></div></div>
